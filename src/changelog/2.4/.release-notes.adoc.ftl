    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

== ${release.version}

This is the eighth GA release.
It contains several bugfixes and new features.
As of this release Log4j now requires a minimum of Java 7.

Apache Log4j 2.4 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run.
Log4j 2.4 and greater requires Java 7, version 2.3 required Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
