This patch release contains only the fix of a `log4j-jcl` bug that prevents it from connecting with `commons-logging`.

The Log4j 2.21.1 API, as well as the other artifacts, maintains binary compatibility with the previous release.

Log4j 2.21.1 requires Java 8 to run.
The build requires JDK 11 and generates reproducible binaries.

For complete information on Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, get support, or suggestions for improvement, see
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html[the Log4j 2 website].
