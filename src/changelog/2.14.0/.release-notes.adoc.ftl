    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

This release contains a new Layout, `JsonTemplateLayout`, that is intended to ultimately replace `JsonLayout`.
As its name suggests it uses a template to define the elements to include in the JSON.
This Layout was contributed by the author of the https://github.com/vy/log4j2-logstash-layout[log4j2-logstash-layout], and who is now a member of the Log4j community.

Log4j 2.14.0 adds support for MongoDB 4 and removes support for MongoDB 2.

This release also contains a number of bug fixes which are listed below.

Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
`log4j-slf4j-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and `log4j-slf4j18-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and later.

The Log4j 2.14.0 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Log4j 2.14.0 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run.
Log4j 2.12.1 is the last release to support Java 7.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
