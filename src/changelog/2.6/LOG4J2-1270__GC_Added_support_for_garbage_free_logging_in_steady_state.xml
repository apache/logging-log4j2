  <description format="asciidoc">(GC) Added support for garbage-free logging in steady state.
        This includes Async Loggers and logging synchronously to the console and to a file,
        but does not include the AsyncAppender. This release makes the GelfLayout and
        the main patterns in the PatternLayout garbage-free.</description>
