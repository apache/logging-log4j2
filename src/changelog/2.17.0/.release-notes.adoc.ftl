    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

The major changes contained in this release include:

* Address CVE-2021-45105 by disabling recursive evaluation of Lookups during log event processing.
Recursive evaluation is still allowed while generating the configuration.
* The `JndiLookup`, `JndiContextSelector`, and `JMSAppender` now require individual system properties to be enabled.
* Remove LDAP and LDAPS as supported protocols from JNDI.

The single `log4j2.enableJndi` property introduced in Log4j 2.16.0 has been replaced with three individual properties; `log4j2.enableJndiContextSelector`, `log4j2.enableJndiJms`, and `log4j2.enableJndiLookup`.

The Log4j 2.17.0 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Apache Log4j 2.17.0 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run.
Log4j 2.12.2 is the last release to support Java 7.
Java 7 is no longer supported by the Log4j team.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
