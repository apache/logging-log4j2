    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

The major changes contained in this release include:

* Address CVE-2021-45105 by disabling recursive evaluation of Lookups during log event processing.
Recursive evaluation is still allowed while generating the configuration.
* The `JndiLookup`, `JndiContextSelector`, and `JMSAppender` now require individual system properties to be enabled.
* Remove LDAP and LDAPS as supported protocols from JNDI.

The single `log4j2.enableJndi` property introduced in Log4j 2.16.0 has been replaced with three individual properties:
xref:manual/systemproperties.adoc#log4j2.enableJndiContextSelector[`log4j2.enableJndiContextSelector`],
xref:manual/systemproperties.adoc#log4j2.enableJndiJms[`log4j2.enableJndiJms`],
and
 xref:manual/systemproperties.adoc#log4j2.enableJndiLookup[`log4j2.enableJndiLookup`].

The Log4j 2.17.0 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Log4j 2.17.0 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run.
Log4j 2.12.2 is the last release to support Java 7.
Java 7 is no longer supported by the Log4j team.
