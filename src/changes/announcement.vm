              Apache Log4j ${relVersion} RELEASE NOTES

The ${developmentTeam} is pleased to announce the Log4j ${relVersion} release!

Apache log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade to
Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides
many other modern features such as support for Markers, property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on
a PatternLayout and asynchronous Loggers. In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

This is the ${relCount} GA release. It is primarily a bugfix release. More details on the fixes are itemized below.

Note that subsequent to the 2.6 release a minor source incompatibility was found due to the addition of new methods to
the Logger interface. If you have code that does:

logger.error(null, “This is the log message”, throwable);

or similar with any log level you will get a compiler error saying the reference is ambiguous.  To correct this either do:

logger.error(“This is the log message”, throwable);

or

logger.error((Marker) null, “This is the log message”, throwable);

Log4j 2.6 maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

## Hack to improve layout: replace all pairs of spaces with a single new-line
$release.description.replaceAll("  ", "
")

Apache Log4j ${relVersion} requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run. Log4j 2.3 was the last release that
supported Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j-1.2-api component, however it does not implement some of the
very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to
org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.
