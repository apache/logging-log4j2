= JMX
Remko Popma <remkop@yahoo.com>

Log4j 2 has built-in support for JMX. The StatusLogger, ContextSelector,
and all LoggerContexts, LoggerConfigs and Appenders are instrumented
with MBeans and can be remotely monitored and controlled.

Also included is a simple client GUI that can be used to monitor the
StatusLogger output, as well as to remotely reconfigure Log4j with a
different configuration file, or to edit the current configuration
directly.

[#Enabling_JMX]
== Enabling JMX

JMX support is enabled by default. When Log4j initializes, the
StatusLogger, ContextSelector, and all LoggerContexts, LoggerConfigs and
Appenders are instrumented with MBeans. To disable JMX completely, and
prevent these MBeans from being created, specify system property
`log4j2.disableJmx` to `true` when you start the Java VM.

[#Local]
== Local Monitoring and Management

To perform local monitoring you don't need to specify any system
properties. The JConsole tool that is included in the Java JDK can be
used to monitor your application. Start JConsole by typing
`$JAVA_HOME/bin/jconsole` in a command shell. For more details,
see Oracle's documentation on
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html[how
to use JConsole].

[#Remote]
== Remote Monitoring and Management

To enable monitoring and management from remote systems, set the
following system property when starting the Java VM.

`com.sun.management.jmxremote.port=portNum`

In the property above, `portNum` is the port number through which you
want to enable JMX RMI connections.

For more details, see Oracle's documentation on
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html#gdenl[Remote
Monitoring and Management].

[#RMI_GC]
== RMI impact on Garbage Collection

Be aware that RMI by default triggers a full GC every hour. See the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/sunrmiproperties.html[Oracle
documentation] for the `sun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval` and
`sun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval` properties. The default value of both
properties is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour). Before Java 6, it was one
minute.

The two sun.rmi arguments reflect whether your JVM is running in server
or client mode. If you want to modify the GC interval time it may be
best to specify both properties to ensure the argument is picked up by
the JVM.

An alternative may be to disable explicit calls to `System.gc()`
altogether with `-XX:+DisableExplicitGC`, or (if you are using the CMS
or G1 collector) add `-XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent` to ensure the
full GCs are done concurrently in parallel with your application instead
of forcing a stop-the-world collection.

[#Log4j_MBeans]
== Log4j Instrumented Components

The best way to find out which methods and attributes of the various
Log4j components are accessible via JMX is to look at the
link:../log4j-core/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/jmx/package-summary.html[Javadoc]
or by exploring directly in JConsole.

The screenshot below shows the Log4j MBeans in JConsole.

MBeans tab]

[#ClientGUI]
== Client GUI

Log4j includes a basic client GUI that can be used to monitor the
StatusLogger output and to remotely modify the Log4j configuration. The
client GUI can be run as a stand-alone application or as a JConsole
plug-in.

=== Running the Client GUI as a JConsole Plug-in

To run the Log4j JMX Client GUI as a JConsole Plug-in, start JConsole
with the following command:

`$JAVA_HOME/bin/jconsole -pluginpath /path/to/log4j-api-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar:/path/to/log4j-core-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar:/path/to/log4j-jmx-gui-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar`

or on Windows:

`%JAVA_HOME%\bin\jconsole -pluginpath \path\to\log4j-api-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar;\path\to\log4j-core-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar;\path\to\log4j-jmx-gui-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar`

If you execute the above command and connect to your application, you
will see an extra "Log4j 2" tab in the JConsole window. This tab
contains the client GUI, with the StatusLogger selected. The screenshot
below shows the StatusLogger panel in JConsole.

StatusLogger display]

=== Remotely Editing the Log4j Configuration

The client GUI also contains a simple editor that can be used to
remotely change the Log4j configuration.

The screenshot below shows the configuration edit panel in JConsole.

image:../images/jmx-jconsole-editconfig.png[JConsole screenshot of the
configuration file editor]

The configuration edit panel provides two ways to modify the Log4j
configuration: specifying a different configuration location URI, or
modifying the configuration XML directly in the editor panel.

If you specify a different configuration location URI and click the
"Reconfigure from Location" button, the specified file or resource must
exist and be readable by the application, or an error will occur and the
configuration will not change. If an error occurred while processing the
contents of the specified resource, Log4j will keep its original
configuration, but the editor panel will show the contents of the file
you specified.

The text area showing the contents of the configuration file is
editable, and you can directly modify the configuration in this editor
panel. Clicking the "Reconfigure with XML below" button will send the
configuration text to the remote application where it will be used to
reconfigure Log4j on the fly. This will not overwrite any configuration
file. Reconfiguring with text from the editor happens in memory only and
the text is not permanently stored anywhere.

[#ClientStandAlone]
=== Running the Client GUI as a Stand-alone Application

To run the Log4j JMX Client GUI as a stand-alone application, run the
following command:

`$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -cp /path/to/log4j-api-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar:/path/to/log4j-core-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar:/path/to/log4j-jmx-gui-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar org.apache.logging.log4j.jmx.gui.ClientGui <options>`

or on Windows:

`%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java -cp \path\to\log4j-api-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar;\path\to\log4j-core-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar;\path\to\log4j-jmx-gui-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar org.apache.logging.log4j.jmx.gui.ClientGui <options>`

Where `options` are one of the following:

* `<host>:<port>`
* `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://<host>:<port>/jmxrmi`
* `service:jmx:rmi://<host>:<port>/jndi/rmi://<host>:<port>/jmxrmi`

The port number must be the same as the portNum specified when you
started the application you want to monitor.

For example, if you started your application with these options:

....
com.sun.management.jmxremote.port=33445
com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
....

*(Note that this disables _all_ security so this is not recommended for
production environments. Oracle's documentation on
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html#gdenl[Remote
Monitoring and Management] provides details on how to configure JMX more
securely with password authentication and SSL.)*

Then you can run the client with this command:

`$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -cp /path/to/log4j-api-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar:/path/to/log4j-core-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar:/path/to/log4j-jmx-gui-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar org.apache.logging.log4j.jmx.gui.ClientGui localhost:33445`

or on Windows:

`%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java -cp \path\to\log4j-api-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar;\path\to\log4j-core-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar;\path\to\log4j-jmx-gui-{Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar org.apache.logging.log4j.jmx.gui.ClientGui localhost:33445`

The screenshot below shows the StatusLogger panel of the client GUI when
running as a stand-alone application.

The screenshot below shows the configuration editor panel of the client
GUI when running as a stand-alone application.
