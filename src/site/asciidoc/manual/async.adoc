= Lock-free Asynchronous Loggers for Low-Latency Logging
Remko Popma <rpopma@apache.org>

Asynchronous logging can improve your application's performance by
executing the I/O operations in a separate thread. Log4j 2 makes a
number of improvements in this area.

* *Asynchronous Loggers* are a new addition in Log4j 2. Their aim is to
return from the call to Logger.log to the application as soon as
possible. You can choose between making all Loggers asynchronous or
using a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous Loggers. Making all
Loggers asynchronous will give the best performance, while mixing gives
you more flexibility.
* *LMAX Disruptor technology*. Asynchronous Loggers internally use the
link:#UnderTheHood[Disruptor], a lock-free inter-thread communication
library, instead of queues, resulting in higher throughput and lower
latency.
* As part of the work for Async Loggers, *Asynchronous Appenders* have
been enhanced to flush to disk at the end of a batch (when the queue is
empty). This produces the same result as configuring
"immediateFlush=true", that is, all received log events are always
available on disk, but is more efficient because it does not need to
touch the disk on each and every log event. (Async Appenders use
ArrayBlockingQueue internally and do not need the disruptor jar on the
classpath.)

[#Trade-offs]
== Trade-offs

Although asynchronous logging can give significant performance benefits,
there are situations where you may want to choose synchronous logging.
This section describes some of the trade-offs of asynchronous logging.

=== Benefits

* Higher peak link:#Performance[throughput]. With an asynchronous logger
your application can log messages at 6 - 68 times the rate of a
synchronous logger.
+
This is especially interesting for applications that occasionally need
to log bursts of messages. Async logging can help prevent or dampen
latency spikes by shortening the wait time until the next message can be
logged. If the queue size is configured large enough to handle the
burst, asynchronous logging will help prevent your application from
falling behind (as much) during a sudden increase of activity.
* Lower logging response time link:#Latency[latency]. Response time
latency is the time it takes for a call to Logger.log to return under a
given workload. Asynchronous Loggers have consistently lower latency
than synchronous loggers or even queue-based asynchronous appenders.

=== Drawbacks

* Error handling. If a problem happens during the logging process and an
exception is thrown, it is less easy for an asynchronous logger or
appender to signal this problem to the application. This can partly be
alleviated by configuring an `ExceptionHandler`, but this may still not
cover all cases. For this reason, if logging is part of your business
logic, for example if you are using Log4j as an audit logging framework,
we would recommend to synchronously log those audit messages. (Note that
you can still link:#MixedSync-Async[combine] them and use asynchronous
logging for debug/trace logging in addition to synchronous logging for
the audit trail.)
* In some rare cases, care must be taken with mutable messages. Most of
the time you don't need to worry about this. Log4 will ensure that log
messages like `logger.debug("My object is {}", myObject)` will use the
state of the `myObject` parameter at the time of the call to
`logger.debug()`. The log message will not change even if `myObject` is
modified later. It is safe to asynchronously log mutable objects because
most
link:../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/Message.html[`Message`]
implementations built-in to Log4j take a snapshot of the parameters.
There are some exceptions however:
link:../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/MapMessage.html[`MapMessage`]
and
link:../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/StructuredDataMessage.html[`StructuredDataMessage`]
are mutable by design: fields can be added to these messages after the
message object was created. These messages should not be modified after
they are logged with asynchronous loggers or asynchronous appenders; you
may or may not see the modifications in the resulting log output.
Similarly, custom
link:../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/Message.html[`Message`]
implementations should be designed with asynchronous use in mind, and
either take a snapshot of their parameters at construction time, or
document their thread-safety characteristics.
* If your application is running in an environment where CPU resources
are scarce, like a machine with one CPU with a single core, starting
another thread is not likely to give better performance.
* If the _sustained rate_ at which your application is logging messages
is faster than the maximum sustained throughput of the underlying
appender, the queue will fill up and the application will end up logging
at the speed of the slowest appender. If this happens, consider
selecting a link:../performance.html#whichAppender[faster appender], or
logging less. If neither of these is an option, you may get better
throughput and fewer latency spikes by logging synchronously.

[#AllAsync]
== Making All Loggers Asynchronous

NOTE: _Log4j-2.9 and higher require disruptor-3.3.4.jar or higher on the
classpath. Prior to Log4j-2.9, disruptor-3.0.0.jar or higher was
required._

This is simplest to configure and gives the best performance. To make
all loggers asynchronous, add the disruptor jar to the classpath and set
the system property `log4j2.contextSelector` to
`org.apache.logging.log4j.core.async.AsyncLoggerContextSelector` or
`org.apache.logging.log4j.core.async.BasicAsyncLoggerContextSelector`.

By default, link:#Location[location] is not passed to the I/O thread by
asynchronous loggers. If one of your layouts or custom filters needs
location information, you need to set "includeLocation=true" in the
configuration of all relevant loggers, including the root logger.

A configuration that does not require location might look like:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!-- Don't forget to set system property
-Dlog4j2.contextSelector=org.apache.logging.log4j.core.async.AsyncLoggerContextSelector
or
-Dlog4j2.contextSelector=org.apache.logging.log4j.core.async.BasicAsyncLoggerContextSelector
     to make all loggers asynchronous. -->

<Configuration status="WARN">
  <Appenders>
    <!-- Async Loggers will auto-flush in batches, so switch off immediateFlush. -->
    <RandomAccessFile name="RandomAccessFile" fileName="async.log" immediateFlush="false" append="false">
      <PatternLayout>
        <Pattern>%d %p %c{1.} [%t] %m %ex%n</Pattern>
      </PatternLayout>
    </RandomAccessFile>
  </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    <Root level="info" includeLocation="false">
      <AppenderRef ref="RandomAccessFile"/>
    </Root>
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>
----

When `AsyncLoggerContextSelector` or
`BasicAsyncLoggerContextSelector` is used to make all loggers
asynchronous, make sure to use normal `<root>` and `<logger>` elements
in the configuration. The context selector will ensure that
all loggers are asynchronous, using a mechanism that is different from
what happens when you configure `<asyncRoot>` or `<asyncLogger>`. The
latter elements are intended for mixing async with sync loggers. If you
use both mechanisms together you will end up with two background
threads, where your application passes the log message to thread A,
which passes the message to thread B, which then finally logs the
message to disk. This works, but there will be an unnecessary step in
the middle.

There are a few system properties you can use to control aspects of the
asynchronous logging subsystem. Some of these can be used to tune
logging performance.

The below properties can also be specified by creating a file named
`log4j2.component.properties` and including this file in the classpath
of the application.

NOTE: System properties were renamed into a more consistent style in
Log4j 2.10.0. All old property names are still supported which are
documented link:configuration.html#SystemProperties[here].

[[SysPropsAllAsync]]

.System Properties to configure all asynchronous loggers
[cols="5m,2,10a",options="header"]
|===
|System Property |Default Value |Description

|log4j2.asyncLoggerExceptionHandler
|`default handler` 
|
Fully qualified name of a class that implements the
`com.lmax.disruptor.ExceptionHandler` interface. The class needs to have
a public zero-argument constructor. If specified, this class will be
notified when an exception occurs while logging the messages.

If not specified, the default exception handler will print a message and
stack trace to the standard error output stream.

|log4j2.asyncLoggerRingBufferSize
|256 * 1024
|
Size (number of slots) in the RingBuffer used by the asynchronous
logging subsystem. Make this value large enough to deal with bursts of
activity. The minimum size is 128. The RingBuffer will be pre-allocated
at first use and will never grow or shrink during the life of the
system.

When the application is logging faster than the underlying appender can
keep up with for a long enough time to fill up the queue, the behaviour
is determined by the
link:../log4j-core/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/async/AsyncQueueFullPolicy.html[AsyncQueueFullPolicy].

|[[asyncLoggerWaitStrategy]]log4j2.asyncLoggerWaitStrategy
|`Timeout`
|Valid values: Block,
Timeout, Sleep, Yield.
(See also the <<Custom WaitStrategy>> section below.) +
`Block` is a strategy that uses a lock and condition variable for the
I/O thread waiting for log events. Block can be used when throughput and
low-latency are not as important as CPU resource. Recommended for
resource constrained/virtualised environments. +
`Timeout` is a variation of the `Block` strategy that will periodically
wake up from the lock condition await() call. This ensures that if a
notification is missed somehow the consumer thread is not stuck but will
recover with a small latency delay (default 10ms). +
`Sleep` is a strategy that initially spins, then uses a Thread.yield(),
and eventually parks for the minimum number of nanos the OS and JVM will
allow while the I/O thread is waiting for log events. Sleep is a good
compromise between performance and CPU resource. This strategy has very
low impact on the application thread, in exchange for some additional
latency for actually getting the message logged. +
`Yield` is a strategy that uses a Thread.yield() for waiting for log
events after an initially spinning. Yield is a good compromise between
performance and CPU resource, but may use more CPU than Sleep in order
to get the message logged to disk sooner.

|log4j2.asyncLoggerTimeout
|`10`
|Timeout in milliseconds of `TimeoutBlockingWaitStrategy`. See
link:#asyncLoggerWaitStrategy[WaitStrategy System Property] for details.

|log4j2.asyncLoggerSleepTimeNs
|`100`
|Sleep time (in nanoseconds) of `SleepingWaitStrategy`. See
link:#asyncLoggerWaitStrategy[WaitStrategy System Property] for details.

|log4j2.asyncLoggerRetries
|`200`
|Total number of spin cycles and `Thread.yield()` cycles of `SleepingWaitStrategy`. See
link:#asyncLoggerWaitStrategy[WaitStrategy System Property] for details.



|AsyncLogger.SynchronizeEnqueueWhenQueueFull
|`true`
|Synchronizes access to the Disruptor ring buffer for blocking enqueue operations when the queue is full.
Users encountered excessive CPU utilization with Disruptor v3.4.2 when the application
was logging more than the underlying appender could keep up with and the ring buffer became full,
especially when the number of application threads vastly outnumbered the number of cores.
CPU utilization is significantly reduced by restricting access to the enqueue operation. Setting this value
to `false` may lead to very high CPU utilization when the async logging queue is full.

|log4j2.asyncLoggerThreadNameStrategy
|`CACHED`
|Valid values: CACHED, UNCACHED.
By default, AsyncLogger caches the thread name in a ThreadLocal variable
to improve performance. Specify the `UNCACHED` option if your
application modifies the thread name at runtime (with
`Thread.currentThread().setName()`) and you want to see the new thread
name reflected in the log.

|log4j2.clock
|`SystemClock`
|Implementation of the `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.time.Clock`
interface that is used for timestamping the log events when all loggers
are asynchronous.
By default, `System.currentTimeMillis` is called on every log event.

`CachedClock` is an optimization intended for low-latency applications
where time stamps are generated from a clock that updates its internal
time in a background thread once every millisecond, or every 1024 log
events, whichever comes first. This reduces logging latency a little, at
the cost of some precision in the logged time stamps. Unless you are
logging many events, you may see "jumps" of 10-16 milliseconds between
log time stamps. WEB APPLICATION WARNING: The use of a background thread
may cause issues for web applications and OSGi applications so
CachedClock is not recommended for this kind of applications.

You can also specify the fully qualified class name of a custom class
that implements the `Clock` interface.

|===

There are also a few system properties that can be used to maintain
application throughput even when the underlying appender cannot keep up
with the logging rate and the queue is filling up. See the details for
system properties
link:configuration.html#asyncQueueFullPolicy[`log4j2.asyncQueueFullPolicy`
and `log4j2.discardThreshold`].

[#MixedSync-Async]
== Mixing Synchronous and Asynchronous Loggers

NOTE: _Log4j-2.9 and higher require disruptor-3.3.4.jar or higher on the
classpath. Prior to Log4j-2.9, disruptor-3.0.0.jar or higher was
required. There is no need to set system property "Log4jContextSelector"
to any value._

Synchronous and asynchronous loggers can be combined in configuration.
This gives you more flexibility at the cost of a slight loss in
performance (compared to making all loggers asynchronous). Use the
`<asyncRoot>` or `<asyncLogger>` configuration elements to specify the
loggers that need to be asynchronous. A configuration can contain only
one root logger (either a `<root>` or an `<asyncRoot>` element), but
otherwise async and non-async loggers may be combined. For example, a
configuration file containing `<asyncLogger>` elements can also contain
`<root>` and `<logger>` elements for the synchronous loggers.

By default, link:#Location[location] is not passed to the I/O thread by
asynchronous loggers. If one of your layouts or custom filters needs
location information, you need to set "includeLocation=true" in the
configuration of all relevant loggers, including the root logger.

A configuration that mixes asynchronous loggers might look like:

[source,xml]
----

<!-- No need to set system property "log4j2.contextSelector" to any value
     when using <asyncLogger> or <asyncRoot>. -->

      </PatternLayout>
    </RandomAccessFile>
  </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    <!-- pattern layout actually uses location, so we need to include it -->
    <AsyncLogger name="com.foo.Bar" level="trace" includeLocation="true">

[#WaitStrategy]
== Custom WaitStrategy
The system properties mentioned above allow only choice from among a fixed set of predefined WaitStrategies.
There may be cases where you want to configure a custom WaitStrategy that is not in this list.
This is possible by using a `AsyncWaitStrategyFactory` element in the Log4j configuration.

A configuration that configures a custom WaitStrategy can look as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN">

  <AsyncWaitStrategyFactory
      class="my.custom.AsyncWaitStrategyFactory" />

  <Appenders>
    <File name="MyFile" fileName="logs/app.log">
      <PatternLayout pattern="%d %p %c{1.} [%t] %m%n" />
    </File>
  </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    <AsyncRoot level="info">
      <AppenderRef ref="MyFile"/>
    </AsyncRoot>
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>
----

The specified class must implement the
`org.apache.logging.log4j.core.async.AsyncWaitStrategyFactory` interface, which is defined as follows:

[source,java]
----
public interface AsyncWaitStrategyFactory {
  /**
  * Returns a non-null implementation of the LMAX Disruptor's WaitStrategy interface.
  * This WaitStrategy will be used by Log4j Async Loggers and Async LoggerConfigs.
  *
  * @return the WaitStrategy instance to be used by Async Loggers and Async LoggerConfigs
  */
  WaitStrategy createWaitStrategy();
}
----

The specified class must also have a public no-argument constructor;
Log4j will instantiate an instance of the specified factory class and use this factory to create the WaitStrategy used by all Async Loggers.

WaitStrategy-related system properties are ignored if a `AsyncWaitStrategyFactory` is configured.


[#Location]
== Location, location, location...

If one of the layouts is configured with a location-related attribute
like HTML link:layouts.html#HtmlLocationInfo[locationInfo], or one of
the patterns link:layouts.html#PatternClass[%C or $class],
link:layouts.html#PatternFile[%F or %file],
link:layouts.html#PatternLocation[%l or %location],
link:layouts.html#PatternLine[%L or %line],
link:layouts.html#PatternMethod[%M or %method], Log4j will take a
snapshot of the stack, and walk the stack trace to find the location
information.

This is an expensive operation: 1.3 - 5 times slower for synchronous
loggers. Synchronous loggers wait as long as possible before they take
this stack snapshot. If no location is required, the snapshot will never
be taken.

However, asynchronous loggers need to make this decision before passing
the log message to another thread; the location information will be lost
after that point. The
link:../performance.html#asyncLoggingWithLocation[performance impact] of
taking a stack trace snapshot is even higher for asynchronous loggers:
logging with location is 30-100 times slower than without location. For
this reason, asynchronous loggers and asynchronous appenders do not
include location information by default.

You can override the default behaviour in your logger or asynchronous
appender configuration by specifying `includeLocation="true"`.

[#Performance]
== Asynchronous Logging Performance

The throughput performance results below were derived from running the
PerfTest, MTPerfTest and PerfTestDriver classes which can be found in
the Log4j 2 unit test source directory. For throughput tests, the
methodology used was:

* First, warm up the JVM by logging 200,000 log messages of 500
characters.
* Repeat the warm-up 10 times, then wait 10 seconds for the I/O thread
to catch up and buffers to drain.
* Measure how long it takes to execute 256 * 1024 / threadCount calls to
Logger.log and express the result in messages per second.
* Repeat the test 5 times and average the results.

The results below were obtained with log4j-2.0-beta5,
disruptor-3.0.0.beta3, log4j-1.2.17 and logback-1.0.10.

=== Logging Peak Throughput

The graph below compares the throughput of synchronous loggers,
asynchronous appenders and asynchronous loggers. This is the total
throughput of all threads together. In the test with 64 threads,
asynchronous loggers are 12 times faster than asynchronous appenders,
and 68 times faster than synchronous loggers.

Asynchronous loggers' throughput increases with the number of threads,
whereas both synchronous loggers and asynchronous appenders have more or
less constant throughput regardless of the number of threads that are
doing the logging.

image:../images/async-vs-sync-throughput.png[Async loggers have much
higher throughput than sync loggers.]

=== Asynchronous Throughput Comparison with Other Logging Packages

We also compared peak throughput of asynchronous loggers to the
synchronous loggers and asynchronous appenders available in other
logging packages, specifically log4j-1.2.17 and logback-1.0.10, with
similar results. For asynchronous appenders, total logging throughput of
all threads together remains roughly constant when adding more threads.
Asynchronous loggers make more effective use of the multiple cores
available on the machine in multi-threaded scenarios.

[#Latency]
=== Response Time Latency

This section has been rewritten with the Log4j 2.6 release. The
previous version only reported _service time_ instead of _response
time_. See the link:../performance.html#responseTime[response time] side
bar on the performance page on why this is too optimistic. Furthermore
the previous version reported average latency, which does not make sense
since latency is not a normal distribution. Finally, the previous
version of this section only reported the maximum latency of up to
99.99% of the measurements, which does not tell you how bad the worst
0.01% were. This is unfortunate because often the "outliers" are all
that matter when it comes to response time. From this release we will
try to do better and report response time latency across the full range
of percentages, including all the outliers. Our thanks to Gil Tene for
his http://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-response-time[How NOT to
measure latency] presentation. (Now we know why this is also known as
the "Oh s#@t!" presentation.)

link:../performance.html#responseTime[Response time] is how long it
takes to log a message under a certain load. What is often reported as
latency is actually _service time_: how long it took to perform the
operation. This hides the fact that a single spike in service time adds
queueing delay for many of the subsequent operations. Service time is
easy to measure (and often looks good on paper) but is irrelevant for
users since it omits the time spent waiting for service. For this reason
we report response time: service time plus wait time.

The response time test results below were all derived from running the
ResponseTimeTest class which can be found in the Log4j 2 unit test
source directory. If you want to run these tests yourself, here are the
command line options we used:

* -Xms1G -Xmx1G (prevent heap resizing during the test)
* -DLog4jContextSelector=org.apache.logging.log4j.core.async.AsyncLoggerContextSelector
-DAsyncLogger.WaitStrategy=busyspin (to use Async Loggers. The BusySpin
wait strategy reduces some jitter.)
* *classic mode:* -Dlog4j2.enable.threadlocals=false
-Dlog4j2.enable.direct.encoders=false +
*garbage-free mode:* -Dlog4j2.enable.threadlocals=true
-Dlog4j2.enable.direct.encoders=true
* -XX:CompileCommand=dontinline,org.apache.logging.log4j.core.async.perftest.NoOpIdleStrategy::idle
* -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps
-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution -XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime
-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime (to eyeball GC and safepoint pauses)

The graph below compares response time latency of the
ArrayBlockingQueue-based asynchronous appenders in Logback 1.1.7, Log4j
1.2.17 to the various options for asynchronous logging that Log4j 2.6
offers. Under a workload of 128,000 messages per second, using 16
threads (each logging at a rate of 8,000 messages per second), we see
that Logback 1.1.7, Log4j 1.2.17 experience latency spikes that are
orders of magnitude larger than Log4j 2.

threads generate a total workload of 128,000 msg/sec, Logback 1.1.7 and
Log4j 1.2.17 experience latency spikes that are orders of magnitude
larger than Log4j 2]

The graph below zooms in on the Log4j 2 results for the same test. We
see that the worst-case response time is highest for the
ArrayBlockingQueue-based Async Appender.

[#UnderTheHood]
== Under The Hood

Asynchronous Loggers are implemented using the
https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/[LMAX Disruptor] inter-thread
messaging library. From the LMAX web site:

____
...using queues to pass data between stages of the system was
introducing latency, so we focused on optimising this area. The
Disruptor is the result of our research and testing. We found that cache
misses at the CPU-level, and locks requiring kernel arbitration are both
extremely costly, so we created a framework which has "mechanical
sympathy" for the hardware it's running on, and that's lock-free.
