Log4j plugin system is the de facto extension mechanism embraced by various Log4j components.
Plugins provide extension points to components, that can be used to implement new features, without modifying the original component.
It is analogous to a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection[dependency injection] framework, but curated for Log4j-specific needs.

In a nutshell, you annotate your classes with link:../javadoc/log4j-plugins/org/apache/logging/log4j/plugins/Plugin.html[`@Plugin`] and their (`static`) factory methods with link:../javadoc/log4j-plugins/org/apache/logging/log4j/plugins/Factory.html[`@Factory`].
Last, you inform the Log4j plugin system to discover these custom classes.
This is done using running the link:../javadoc/log4j-plugin-processor/org/apache/logging/log4j/plugin/processor/PluginProcessor.html[`PluginProcessor`] annotation processor while building your project.
Refer to xref:manual/plugins.adoc[] for details.
