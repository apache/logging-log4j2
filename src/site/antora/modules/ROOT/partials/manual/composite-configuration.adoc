// tag::intro[]
There are occasions where multiple configurations might need to be combined.
For instance,

* You have a common Log4j Core configuration that should always be present, and an environment-specific one that extends the common one depending on the environment (test, production, etc.) the application is running on.
* You develop a framework, and it contains a predefined Log4j Core configuration.
Yet you want to allow users to extend it whenever necessary.
* You collect Log4j Core configurations from multiple sources.
// end::intro[]

// tag::how[]
`CompositeConfiguration` merges multiple configurations into a single one using a link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/config/composite/MergeStrategy.html[`MergeStrategy`], which can be customized using xref:manual/systemproperties.adoc#log4j.configuration.mergeStrategy[the `log4j.configuration.mergeStrategy` configuration property].
The default merge strategy works as follows:

* xref:manual/configuration.adoc#global-configuration-attributes[Global configuration attributes] in later configurations replace those in previous configurations.
The only exception is the `monitorInterval` attribute: the lowest positive value from all the configuration files will be used.

* xref:manual/configuration.adoc#property-substitution[Properties] are aggregated.
Duplicate properties override those in previous configurations.

* xref:manual/filters.adoc[Filters] are aggregated under xref:manual/filters.adoc#CompositeFilter[`CompositeFilter`], if more than one filter is defined.

* xref:manual/scripts.adoc[] are aggregated.
Duplicate definitions override those in previous configurations.

* xref:manual/appenders.adoc[Appenders] are aggregated.
Appenders with the same name are **overridden** by those in later configurations, including all their elements.

* xref:manual/configuration.adoc#configuring-loggers[Loggers] are aggregated.
Logger attributes are individually merged, and those in later configurations replace duplicates.
Appender references on a logger are aggregated, and those in later configurations replace duplicates.
The strategy merges filters on loggers using the rule above.
