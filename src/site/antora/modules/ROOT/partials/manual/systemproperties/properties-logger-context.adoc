[id=log4j.loggerContext.selector]

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Env. variable
| `LOG4J_LOGGER_CONTEXT_SELECTOR`

| Type
| link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/selector/ContextSelector.html[`Class<? extends ContextSelector>`]

| Default value
|
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/selector/ClassLoaderContextSelector.html[`ClassLoaderContextSelector`]

(on Android)
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/selector/BasicContextSelector.html[`BasicContextSelector`]
|===

Specifies the fully qualified class name of the
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/selector/ContextSelector.html[`ContextSelector`]
implementation to use.

A `ContextSelector` decides:

* how loggers are split among logger contexts,
* the
{log4j2-url}/javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/Logger.html[`Logger`]
implementation to use.

The implementations available by default are:

link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/selector/BasicContextSelector.html[`org.apache.logging.log4j.core.selector.BasicContextSelector`]::
Creates a single logger context and synchronous loggers.

link:../javadoc/log4j-async-logger/org/apache/logging/log4j/async/logger/BasicAsyncLoggerContextSelector.html[`org.apache.logging.log4j.async.logger.BasicAsyncLoggerContextSelector`]::
Creates a single logger context and xref:manual/async.adoc[asynchronous loggers].

link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/selector/ClassLoaderContextSelector.html[`org.apache.logging.log4j.core.selector.ClassLoaderContextSelector`]::
Creates a separate logger context per classloader and synchronous loggers.

link:../javadoc/log4j-async-logger/org/apache/logging/log4j/async/logger/AsyncLoggerContextSelector.html[`org.apache.logging.log4j.async.logger.AsyncLoggerContextSelector`]::
Creates a separate logger context per classloader and xref:manual/async.adoc[asynchronous loggers].

`org.apache.logging.log4j.jndi.selector.JndiContextSelector`::
Creates loggers contexts based on a JNDI lookup and synchronous loggers.
See
{logging-services-url}/log4j/jakarta/log4j-jakarta-web.html#jndi[Web application]
for details.

There are also third-party context selector implementations:

[IMPORTANT]
====
These context selectors are provided by **third-party** vendors and are not maintained by the
link:{logging-services-url}[Apache Logging Services]
(Log4j, Log4cxx, Log4net) project.
====

https://oss.copernik.eu/tomcat/3.x/components/log4j-tomcat#TomcatContextSelector[`eu.copernik.log4j.tomcat.TomcatContextSelector`]::
Selects the currently active Tomcat web application and creates synchronous loggers.

https://oss.copernik.eu/tomcat/3.x/components/log4j-tomcat#TomcatContextSelector[`eu.copernik.log4j.tomcat.TomcatAsyncContextSelector`]::
Selects the currently active Tomcat web application and creates xref:manual/async.adoc[asynchronous loggers].

[id=log4j.loggerContext.shutdownHookEnabled]
== `log4j.loggerContext.shutdownHookEnabled`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Env. variable | `LOG4J_LOGGER_CONTEXT_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_ENABLED`
| Type          | `boolean`
| Default value | `true`

(Web-app mode: `false`)
|===

If `true` a shutdown hook will be installed to stop the logger context when the system stops.

[id=log4j.loggerContext.shutdownCallbackRegistry]
== `log4j.loggerContext.shutdownCallbackRegistry`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Env. variable
| `LOG4J_LOGGER_CONTEXT_SHUTDOWN_CALLBACK_REGISTRY`

| Type
| link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/util/ShutdownCallbackRegistry.html[`Class<? extends ShutdownCallbackRegistry>`]

| Default value
| link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/util/DefaultShutdownCallbackRegistry.html[`DefaultShutdownCallbackRegistry`]
|===

The fully qualified class name of a
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/util/ShutdownCallbackRegistry.html[`ShutdownCallbackRegistry`]
implementation.
Integrators can use this to customize the shutdown order of the JVM.

The default implementation executes all shutdown actions in a separate `Thread` registered through
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runtime.html#addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread)[`Runtime#addShutdownHook()`].

[id=log4j.loggerContext.stacktraceOnStart]
== `log4j.loggerContext.stacktraceOnStart`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Env. variable | `LOG4J_LOGGER_CONTEXT_STACKTRACE_ON_START`
| Type          | `boolean`
| Default value | `false`
|===

Prints a stacktrace to the
{log4j2-url}/manual/status-logger.html[status logger]
at `DEBUG` level when the LoggerContext is started.

For debug purposes only.
