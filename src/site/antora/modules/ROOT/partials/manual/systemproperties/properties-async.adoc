[id=log4j.async.formatMessagesInBackground]
== `log4j.async.formatMessagesInBackground`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Env. variable | LOG4J_ASYNC_FORMAT_MESSAGES_IN_BACKGROUND
| Type          | `boolean`
| Default value | `false`
|===

If `false`, Log4j will make sure the message is formatted in the caller thread, otherwise the formatting will occur on the asynchronous thread.

**Remark**: messages annotated with
{log4j2-url}/javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/AsynchronouslyFormattable.html[AsynchronouslyFormattable]
will be formatted on the async thread regardless of this setting.

|===
| Env. variable
| LOG4J_ASYNC_QUEUE_FULL_POLICY_TYPE

| Type
| link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/async/AsyncQueueFullPolicy.html[Class<? extends AsyncQueueFullPolicy>]
or predefined constant

| Default value
| `Default`
|===

Determines the
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/async/AsyncQueueFullPolicy.html[AsyncQueueFullPolicy]
to use when the underlying async component cannot keep up with the logging rate and the queue is filling up.

Its value should be the fully qualified class name of an `AsyncQueueFullPolicy` implementation or one of these predefined constants:

Default:: blocks the calling thread until the event can be added to the queue.

Discard:: when the queue is full, it drops the events whose level is equal or less than the threshold level (see
<<log4j.async.queueFullPolicy.discardThreshold>>).

| Env. variable | LOG4J_ASYNC_QUEUE_FULL_POLICY_DISCARD_THRESHOLD
| Type          | {log4j2-url}/javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/Level[Level]
| Default value | `INFO`
|===

Determines the threshold level used by a `Discard` queue full policy.
Log events whose level is equal or less specific than the threshold level will be discarded during a queue full event.
