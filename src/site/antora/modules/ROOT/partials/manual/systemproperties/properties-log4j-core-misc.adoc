| Default value | ``SystemClock``
|===

Specifies the
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/util/Clock.html[`Clock`]
implementation used to timestamp log events.

This must be the fully qualified class name of the implementation or one of these predefined constants:

SystemClock:: uses the best available system clock as time source.
See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java/time/Clock.html#systemDefaultZone--[`Clock#systemDefaultZone()`] for details.

SystemMillisClock:: same as `SystemClock`, but truncates the result to a millisecond.

CachedClock:: uses a separate thread to update the timestamp value.
See
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/util/CachedClock.html[`CachedClock`]
for details.

CoarseCachedClock:: alternative implementation of `CachedClock` with a slightly lower precision.

The value must be the fully qualified class name of a `ReliabilityStrategy` implementation or one of these predefined constants:

AwaitCompletion::
Counts the number of threads that have started to log an event but have not completed yet and waits for these threads to finish before stopping the appenders.

AwaitUnconditionally::
Waits for a configured amount of time before stopping the appenders.
See <<log4j2.waitMillisBeforeStopOldConfig>>.

Locking::
Uses read/write locks to prevent appenders from stopping while some threads are still logging events.
