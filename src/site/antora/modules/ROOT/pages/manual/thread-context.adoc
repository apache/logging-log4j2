= Thread Context

Just like
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html[Java's `ThreadLocal`],
_Thread Context_ facilitates associating information with the executing thread and making this information accessible to the rest of the logging system.
Thread Context is one of many xref:manual/api.adoc#fish-tagging[_fish tagging_ capabilities provided by Log4j API].

[#usage]
== Usage

The entry point for associating logging-related information with the executing thread is
link:../javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/ThreadContext.html[`ThreadContext`].
It offers both

[#mdc]
* map-structured – referred to as _Thread Context Map_ or _Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)_
[#ndc]
* stack-structured – referred to as _Thread Context Stack_ or _Nested Diagnostic Context (NDC)_

storage:

[source,java]
----
ThreadContext.put("ipAddress", request.getRemoteAddr()); // <1>
ThreadContext.put("hostName", request.getServerName()); // <1>
ThreadContext.put("loginId", session.getAttribute("loginId")); // <1>

void performWork() {
    ThreadContext.push("performWork()"); // <2>

    LOGGER.debug("Performing work"); // <3>
    // Perform the work

    ThreadContext.pop(); // <4>
}

ThreadContext.clear(); // <5>
----

<1> Adding properties to the thread context map
<2> Pushing properties to the thread context stack
<3> Added properties can later on be used to, for instance, filter the log event, provide extra information in the layout, etc.
<4> Popping the last pushed property from the thread context stack
<5> Clearing the thread context (for both stack and map!)

[#CloseableThreadContext]
=== Auto-clearing thread context

When placing items on the thread context stack or map, it's necessary to remove them again when appropriate.
To assist with this, you can use
link:../javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/CloseableThreadContext.html[`CloseableThreadContext`]
(implementing
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html[`AutoCloseable`])
in a try-with-resources block:

[source,java]
----
try (CloseableThreadContext.Instance ignored = CloseableThreadContext
        .put("ipAddress", request.getRemoteAddr()) // <1>
        .push("performWork()")) { // <1>

    LOGGER.debug("Performing work"); // <2>
    // Perform the work

}

// ... // <3>
----

<1> Making thread context changes that will only be visible **within the scope of the try-with-resources block**
<2> Added properties can later on be used to, for instance, filter the log event, provide extra information in the layout, etc.
<3> Outside the scope of the try-with-resources block made thread context changes will not be visible

[#init]
=== Initializing thread context

It is a common use case that a single threaded execution fans out to multiple threads by means of a thread pool.
In such a case, you need to clone the context of the current thread to the ones in the pool.
For that purpose, you can use `putAll()` and `pushAll()` methods that are provided by both `ThreadContext` and `CloseableThreadContext`:

[source,java]
----
LOGGER.debug("Starting background thread for user");

Map<String, String> mdc = ThreadContext.getImmutableContext(); // <1>
List<String> ndc = ThreadContext.getImmutableStack().asList(); // <1>

executor.submit(() -> {
    try (CloseableThreadContext.Instance ignored = CloseableThreadContext
            .putAll(mdc) // <2>
            .pushAll(ndc)) { // <2>

        LOGGER.debug("Processing for user started");
        // ...

    }
});
----

<1> Taking a snapshot of the thread context
<2> Initializing the thread context for the background task

[#config]
== Configuration

Since the thread context is inherently linked to the logging implementation, its configuration options depend on the logging implementation used:

Simple Logger::
+
See xref:manual/simple-logger.adoc#thread-context[Thread context configuration of Simple Logger].

Log4j Core::
+
See xref:manual/systemproperties.adoc#properties-thread-context[Thread context configuration of Log4j Core].

Log4j API to SLF4J bridge::
+
All `ThreadContext` method calls are translated into equivalent
https://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/MDC.html[`org.slf4j.MDC`]
method calls.

JUL::
+
All `ThreadContext` method calls are a no-op.

[#extending]
== Extending

Certain thread context implementation details can be customized to fit your use case.

[#custom-ContextDataProvider]
=== Custom thread context data provider

The link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/util/ContextDataProvider.html[`ContextDataProvider`] is an interface applications and libraries can use to inject additional properties into a log events' context data.
Log4j uses `java.util.ServiceLoader` to locate and load `ContextDataProvider` instances.
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/impl/ThreadContextDataProvider.html[`ThreadContextDataProvider`] is the default implementation provided.
You can provide a custom `ContextDataProvider` implementation as follows:

. Create the following file in your class path:
+
[source,text]
----
META-INF/services/org.apache.logging.log4j.core.util.ContextDataProvider
----
. Write the fully-qualified class name of your custom implementation (e.g., `com.mycompany.CustomContextDataProvider`) to the file created in the previous step

[#custom-ThreadContextMap]
=== Custom thread context map

Custom thread context map implementations can be provided by setting <<log4j2.threadContextMap,the `log4j2.threadContextMap` system property>> to the fully-qualified class name of the custom implementation class extending from
link:../javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/spi/ThreadContextMap.html[`ThreadContextMap`].

While providing a custom thread context map implementation, you are advised to also extend from
link:../javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/spi/ReadOnlyThreadContextMap.html[`ReadOnlyThreadContextMap`]
too.
By this way, your custom thread context map implementation will be accessible to applications via
link:../javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/ThreadContext.html#getThreadContextMap()[`ThreadContext.getThreadContextMap()`].
