== Main Components

Log4j uses the classes shown in the diagram below.

image:Log4jClasses.jpg[Log4j 2 Class Relationships,title="Log4j 2 Class Relationships"]

Applications using the Log4j 2 API will request a Logger with a specific
name from the LogManager. The LogManager will locate the appropriate
LoggerContext and then obtain the Logger from it. If the Logger must be
created it will be associated with the LoggerConfig that contains either
a) the same name as the Logger, b) the name of a parent package, or c)
the root LoggerConfig. LoggerConfig objects are created from Logger
declarations in the configuration. The LoggerConfig is associated with
the Appenders that deliver the LogEvents.

[id=logger-hierarchy]
=== Logger Hierarchy

The first and foremost advantage of any logging API over plain
`System.out.println()` resides in its ability to disable certain log
statements while allowing others to print unhindered. This capability
assumes that the logging space, that is, the space of all possible
logging statements, is categorized according to some developer-chosen
criteria.

In Log4j 1.x the Logger Hierarchy was maintained through a relationship
between Loggers. In Log4j 2 this relationship no longer exists. Instead,
the hierarchy is maintained in the relationship between LoggerConfig
objects.

Loggers and LoggerConfigs are named entities. Logger names are
case-sensitive and they follow the hierarchical naming rule:

Named Hierarchy::
A LoggerConfig is said to be an _ancestor_ of another LoggerConfig if
its name followed by a dot is a prefix of the _descendant_ logger
name. A LoggerConfig is said to be a _parent_ of a _child_
LoggerConfig if there are no ancestors between itself and the
descendant LoggerConfig.

For example, the LoggerConfig named `"com.foo"` is a parent of the
LoggerConfig named `"com.foo.Bar"`. Similarly, `"java"` is a parent of
`"java.util"` and an ancestor of `"java.util.Vector"`. This naming
scheme should be familiar to most developers.

The root LoggerConfig resides at the top of the LoggerConfig hierarchy.
It is exceptional in that it always exists and it is part of every
hierarchy. A Logger that is directly linked to the root LoggerConfig can
be obtained as follows:

[source,java]
----
Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(LogManager.ROOT_LOGGER_NAME);
----

Alternatively, and more simply:

[source,java]
----
Logger logger = LogManager.getRootLogger();
----

All other Loggers can be retrieved using the
{log4j2-url}/javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/LogManager.html#getLogger(java.lang.String)[`LogManager.getLogger`]
static method by passing the name of the desired Logger. Further
information on the Logging API can be found in the
xref:manual/api.adoc[Log4j API].

=== LoggerContext

The
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/LoggerContext.html[`LoggerContext`]
acts as the anchor point for the Logging system. However, it is possible
to have multiple active LoggerContexts in an application depending on
the circumstances. More details on the LoggerContext are in the
xref:manual/logsep.adoc[Log Separation] section.

=== Configuration

Every LoggerContext has an active
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/config/Configuration.html[`Configuration`].
The Configuration contains all the Appenders, context-wide Filters,
LoggerConfigs and contains the reference to the StrSubstitutor.
During reconfiguration, two Configuration objects will exist. Once all Loggers
have been redirected to the new Configuration, the old Configuration
will be stopped and discarded.

=== Logger

As stated previously, Loggers are created by calling
{log4j2-url}/javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/LogManager.html#getLogger(java.lang.String)[`LogManager.getLogger`].
The Logger itself performs no direct actions. It simply has a name and
is associated with a LoggerConfig. It extends
{log4j2-url}/javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/spi/AbstractLogger.html[`AbstractLogger`]
and implements the required methods. As the configuration is modified
Loggers may become associated with a different LoggerConfig, thus
causing their behavior to be modified.

Retrieving Loggers

Calling the `LogManager.getLogger` method with the same name will always
return a reference to the same Logger object.

For example, in

[source,java]
----
Logger x = LogManager.getLogger("wombat");
Logger y = LogManager.getLogger("wombat");
----

`x` and `y` refer to _exactly_ the same Logger object.

Configuration of the log4j environment is typically done at application
initialization. The preferred way is by reading a configuration file.
This is discussed in xref:manual/configuration.adoc[Configuration].

Log4j makes it easy to name Loggers by _software component_. This can be
accomplished by instantiating a Logger in each class, with the logger
name equal to the fully qualified name of the class. This is a useful
and straightforward method of defining loggers. As the log output bears
the name of the generating Logger, this naming strategy makes it easy to
identify the origin of a log message. However, this is only one
possible, albeit common, strategy for naming loggers. Log4j does not
restrict the possible set of loggers. The developer is free to name the
loggers as desired.

Since naming Loggers after their owning class is such a common idiom,
the convenience method `LogManager.getLogger()` is provided to
automatically use the calling class's fully qualified class name as the
Logger name.

Nevertheless, naming loggers after the class where they are located
seems to be the best strategy known so far.

[#loggerconfig]
=== LoggerConfig

link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/config/LoggerConfig.html[`LoggerConfig`]
objects are created when Loggers are declared in the logging
configuration. The LoggerConfig contains a set of Filters that must
allow the LogEvent to pass before it will be passed to any Appenders. It
contains references to the set of Appenders that should be used to
process the event.

==== Log Levels

LoggerConfigs will be assigned a Log
{log4j2-url}/javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/Level.html[`Level`].
The set of built-in levels includes ALL, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR,
FATAL, and OFF. Log4j 2 also supports {log4j2-url}/manual/customloglevels.adoc[custom log
levels]. Another mechanism for getting more granularity is to use
{log4j2-url}/manual/markers.adoc[markers] instead. The OFF and ALL
levels are not intended to be used on calls to the logging API.
Specifying OFF in the configuration implies no logging events should
match while specifying ALL would mean all events match, including custom
events. However, OFF can be used on logging API calls in special cases
where the event should always be logged regardless of the configuration.
However, it is generally recommended that a Marker with a corresponding
global Marker Filter be used instead.

{logging-services-url}/log4j/1.x/manual.html[Log4j 1] and
{logback-url}/manual/architecture.html#effectiveLevel[Logback]
both have the concept of "Level Inheritance". In Log4j 2, Loggers and
LoggerConfigs are two different objects so this concept is implemented
differently. Each Logger references the appropriate LoggerConfig which
in turn can reference its parent, thus achieving the same effect.

Below are five tables with various assigned level values and the
resulting levels that will be associated with each Logger. Note that in
all these cases if the root LoggerConfig is not configured a default
Level will be assigned to it.

.Example 1
[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|====================================================================
|Logger Name |Assigned LoggerConfig |LoggerConfig Level |Logger Level
|root |root |DEBUG |DEBUG
|X |root |DEBUG |DEBUG
|X.Y |root |DEBUG |DEBUG
|X.Y.Z |root |DEBUG |DEBUG
|====================================================================

In example 1 above, only the root logger is configured and has a Log
Level. All the other Loggers reference the root LoggerConfig and use its
Level.

.Example 2
[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=============================================================
|Logger Name |Assigned LoggerConfig |LoggerConfig Level |Level
|root |root |DEBUG |DEBUG
|X |X |ERROR |ERROR
|X.Y |X.Y |INFO |INFO
|X.Y.Z |X.Y.Z |WARN |WARN
|=============================================================

In example 2, all loggers have a configured LoggerConfig and obtain
their Level from it.

.Example 3
[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=============================================================
|Logger Name |Assigned LoggerConfig |LoggerConfig Level |Level
|root |root |DEBUG |DEBUG
|X |X |ERROR |ERROR
|X.Y |X |ERROR |ERROR
|X.Y.Z |X.Y.Z |WARN |WARN
|=============================================================

In example 3, the loggers`root`, `X` and `X.Y.Z` each have a configured
LoggerConfig with the same name. The Logger `X.Y` does not have a
configured LoggerConfig with a matching name so uses the configuration
of LoggerConfig `X` since that is the LoggerConfig whose name has the
the longest match to the start of the Logger's name.

.Example 4
[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=============================================================
|Logger Name |Assigned LoggerConfig |LoggerConfig Level |level
|root |root |DEBUG |DEBUG
|X |X |ERROR |ERROR
|X.Y |X |ERROR |ERROR
|X.Y.Z |X |ERROR |ERROR
|=============================================================

In example 4, the loggers `root` and `X` each have a Configured
LoggerConfig with the same name. The loggers `X.Y` and `X.Y.Z` do not
have configured LoggerConfigs and so get their Level from the
LoggerConfig assigned to them, `X`, since it is the LoggerConfig whose
name has the longest match to the start of the Logger's name.

.Example 5
[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=============================================================
|Logger Name |Assigned LoggerConfig |LoggerConfig Level |level
|root |root |DEBUG |DEBUG
|X |X |ERROR |ERROR
|X.Y |X.Y |INFO |INFO
|X.YZ |X |ERROR |ERROR
|=============================================================

In example 5, the loggers `root`.`X`, and `X.Y` each has a configured
LoggerConfig with the same name. The logger `X.YZ` does not have
configured LoggerConfig and so gets its Level from the LoggerConfig
assigned to it, `X`, since it is the LoggerConfig whose name has the
longest match to the start of the Logger's name. It is not associated
with LoggerConfig `X.Y` since tokens after periods must match exactly.

.Example 6
[cols=4*,options="header"]
|===
|Logger Name |Assigned LoggerConfig |LoggerConfig Level |Level
|root |root |DEBUG |DEBUG
|X |X |ERROR |ERROR
|X.Y |X.Y | |ERROR
|X.Y.Z |X.Y | |ERROR
|===

In example 6, LoggerConfig X.Y has no configured level so it inherits
its level from LoggerConfig X. Logger X.Y.Z uses LoggerConfig X.Y since
it doesn't have a LoggerConfig with a name that exactly matches. It too
inherits its logging level from LoggerConfig X.

The table below illustrates how Level filtering works. In the table,
the vertical header shows the Level associated with the appropriate LoggerConfig, while the horizontal
header shows the Level of the LogEvent. The
intersection identifies whether the LogEvent would be allowed to pass
for further processing (Yes) or discarded (No).

[cols=8*,options="header"]
|===
|Event Level
7+|LoggerConfig Level

|  |`TRACE` |`DEBUG` |`INFO` |`WARN` |`ERROR` |`FATAL` |`OFF`

|`ALL` |❌ |❌ |❌ |❌ |❌ |❌ |❌

|`TRACE` |✅ |❌ |❌ |❌ |❌ |❌ |❌

|`DEBUG` |✅ |✅ |❌ |❌ |❌ |❌ |❌

|`INFO` |✅ |✅ |✅ |❌ |❌ |❌ |❌

|`WARN` |✅ |✅ |✅ |✅ |❌ |❌ |❌

|`ERROR` |✅ |✅ |✅ |✅ |✅ |❌ |❌

|`FATAL` |✅ |✅ |✅ |✅ |✅ |✅ |❌

|`OFF` |✅ |✅ |✅ |✅ |✅ |✅ |✅
|===

=== Filter

In addition to the automatic log Level filtering that takes place as
described in the previous section, Log4j provides
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/Filter.html[`Filter`]s
that can be applied before control is passed to any LoggerConfig, after
control is passed to a LoggerConfig but before calling any Appenders,
after control is passed to a LoggerConfig but before calling a specific
Appender, and on each Appender. In a manner very similar to firewall
filters, each Filter can return one of three results, `Accept`, `Deny`
or `Neutral`. A response of `Accept` means that no other Filters should
be called and the event should progress. A response of `Deny` means the
event should be immediately ignored and control should be returned to
the caller. A response of `Neutral` indicates the event should be passed
to other Filters. If there are no other Filters the event will be
processed.

Although an event may be accepted by a Filter the event still might not
be logged. This can happen when the event is accepted by the
pre-LoggerConfig Filter but is then denied by a LoggerConfig filter or
is denied by all Appenders.

=== Appender

The ability to selectively enable or disable logging requests based on
their logger is only part of the picture. Log4j allows logging requests
to print to multiple destinations. In log4j speak, an output destination
is called an
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/Appender.html[`Appender`].
Currently, appenders exist for the console, files, remote socket
servers, Apache Flume, remote UNIX Syslog daemons, and various
database APIs. See the section on xref:manual/appenders.adoc[Appenders] for
more details on the various types available. More than one Appender can
be attached to a Logger.

An Appender can be added to a Logger by calling the
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/config/Configuration.html#addLoggerAppender(org.apache.logging.log4j.core.Logger,%20org.apache.logging.log4j.core.Appender)[`addLoggerAppender`]
method of the current Configuration. If a LoggerConfig matching the name
of the Logger does not exist, one will be created, and the Appender will be
attached to it and then all Loggers will be notified to update their
LoggerConfig references.

*Each enabled logging request for a given logger will be forwarded to
all the appenders in that Logger's LoggerConfig as well as the Appenders
of the LoggerConfig's parents.* In other words, Appenders are inherited
additively from the LoggerConfig hierarchy. For example, if a console
appender is added to the root logger, then all enabled logging requests
will at least print on the console. If in addition a file appender is
added to a LoggerConfig, say _C_, then enabled logging requests for _C_
and _C_'s children will print in a file _and_ on the console. It is
possible to override this default behavior so that Appender accumulation
is no longer additive by setting `additivity="false"` on the Logger
declaration in the configuration file.

The rules governing appender additivity are summarized below.

Appender Additivity::
The output of a log statement of Logger _L_ will go to all the
Appenders in the LoggerConfig associated with _L_ and the ancestors of
that LoggerConfig. This is the meaning of the term "appender
additivity".
+
However, if an ancestor of the LoggerConfig associated with Logger
_L_, say _P_, has the additivity flag set to `false`, then _L_'s
output will be directed to all the appenders in _L_'s LoggerConfig and
it's ancestors up to and including _P_ but not the Appenders in any of
the ancestors of _P_.
+
Loggers have their additivity flag set to `true` by default.

The table below shows an example:

|===
|Logger Name |Added Appenders |Additivity Flag |Output Targets |Comment

|root
|A1
|not applicable
|A1
|The root logger has no parent so additivity does not apply to it.

|x
|A-x1, A-x2
|true
|A1, A-x1, A-x2
|Appenders of "x" and root.

|x.y
|none
|true
|A1, A-x1, A-x2
|Appenders of "x" and root. It would not be typical to configure a Logger with no Appenders.

|x.y.z
|A-xyz1
|true
|A1, A-x1, A-x2, A-xyz1
|Appenders in "x.y.z", "x" and root.

|security
|A-sec
|false
|A-sec
|No appender accumulation since the additivity flag is set to `false`.

|security.access
|none
|true
|A-sec
|Only appenders of "security" because the additivity flag in "security" is set to `false`.
|===

=== Layout

More often than not, users wish to customize not only the output
destination but also the output format. This is accomplished by
associating a
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/Layout.html[`Layout`]
with an Appender. The Layout is responsible for formatting the LogEvent
according to the user's wishes, whereas an appender takes care of
sending the formatted output to its destination. The
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/layout/PatternLayout.html[`PatternLayout`],
part of the standard log4j distribution, lets the user specify the
output format according to conversion patterns similar to the C language
`printf()` function.

For example, the PatternLayout with the conversion pattern "%r [%t] %-5p
%c - %m%n" will output something akin to:

....
176 [main] INFO  org.foo.Bar - Located nearest gas station.
....

The first field is the number of milliseconds elapsed since the start of
the program. The second field is the thread making the log request. The
third field is the level of the log statement. The fourth field is the
name of the logger associated with the log request. The text after the
'-' is the message of the statement.

Log4j comes with many different xref:manual/layouts.adoc[Layouts] for various
use cases such as JSON, XML, HTML, and Syslog (including the new RFC
5424 version). Other appenders such as the database connectors fill in
specified fields instead of a particular textual layout.

Just as importantly, log4j will render the content of the log message
according to user-specified criteria. For example, if you frequently
need to log `Oranges`, an object type used in your current project, then
you can create an OrangeMessage that accepts an Orange instance and pass
that to Log4j so that the Orange object can be formatted into an
appropriate byte array when required.

[#StrSubstitutor]
=== StrSubstitutor and StrLookup

The
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/StrSubstitutor.html[`StrSubstitutor`]
class and
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/StrLookup.html[`StrLookup`]
interface was borrowed from
https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/[Apache Commons Lang] and
then modified to support evaluating LogEvents. In addition the
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/Interpolator.html[`Interpolator`]
class was borrowed from Apache Commons Configuration to allow the
StrSubstitutor to evaluate variables from multiple StrLookups. It
too was modified to support evaluating LogEvents. Together these provide
a mechanism to allow the configuration to reference variables coming
from System Properties, the configuration file, the ThreadContext Map,
StructuredData in the LogEvent. The variables can either be resolved
when the configuration is processed or as each event is processed if
the component is capable of handling it. See xref:manual/lookups.adoc[Lookups]
for more information.
