= Appenders

Appenders are responsible for delivering log events to their destination.
Every Appender must implement the
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/Appender.html[`Appender`]
interface.

While not strictly required by the Log4j Core architecture, most appenders inherit from
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/appender/AbstractAppender.html[`AbstractAppender`]
and:

* delegate the filtering of log events to an implementation of
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/Filter.html[`Filter`].
See xref:manual/filters.adoc[] for more information.
* delegate the formatting of log events to an implementation of
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/Layout.html[`Layout`].
See xref:manual/layouts.adoc[] for more information.
* only directly handle the writing of log event data to the target destination.

Appenders always have a name so that they can be referenced from a
xref:manual/configuration.adoc#configuring-loggers[logger configuration].

[#commons-concerns]
== Common concerns

[#buffering]
=== Buffering

Appenders that use stream-like resources (such as files, TCP connections) have an internal
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html[`ByteBuffer`]
that can be used to format each log event, before sending it to the underlying resource.
The buffer is used if:

* the
xref:manual/systemproperties.adoc#log4j2.enableDirectEncoders[`log4j2.enableDirectEncoders`]
configuration property is enabled,
* or the <<bufferedIo,`bufferedIo`>> configuration attribute is enabled.

The buffer is flushed to the underlying resource on three occasions:

* if the buffer is full.
* at the end of each log event batch, if
xref:manual/async.adoc[asynchronous loggers]
or
xref:manual/appenders/delegating.adoc#AsyncAppender[appenders]
are used.
* at the end of each log event, if the
<<immediateFlush,`immediateFlush`>>
configuration attribute is `true`.

These configuration attributes are shared by multiple appenders:

[#bufferSize]
==== `bufferSize`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Type
| `int`

| Default value
| xref:manual/systemproperties.adoc#log4j2.encoderByteBufferSize[`log4j2.encoderByteBufferSize`]
|===

This configuration attribute specifies the size of the `ByteBuffer` used by the appender.

[#bufferedIo]
==== `bufferedIo`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Type          | `boolean`
| Default value | `true`
|===

If set to `true`, Log4j Core will use an internal `ByteBuffer` to store log events before sending them.

If the xref:manual/systemproperties.adoc#log4j2.enableDirectEncoders[`log4j2.enableDirectEncoders`] configuration property is set to `true`, the internal `ByteBuffer` will always be used.

[#immediateFlush]
==== `immediateFlush`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Type          | `boolean`
| Default value | `true`
|===

If set to `true`, Log4j will flush Log4j Core and Java buffers at the end of each event:

* the internal `ByteBuffer` of the appender will be flushed.
* for appenders based on Java's
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java/io/OutputStream.html[`OutputStream`]
a call to the `OutputStream.flush()` method will be performed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This setting only guarantees that a byte representation of the log event is passed to the operating system.
It does not ensure that the operating system writes the event to the underlying storage.
====

[TIP]
====
If you are using
xref:manual/async.adoc[asynchronous loggers]
or
xref:manual/appenders/delegating.adoc#AsyncAppender[appenders], you can set this attribute to `false`.
Log4j Core will still flush the internal buffer, whenever the log event queue becomes empty.
====

[#exception-handling]
=== Exception handling

By default, Log4j Core uses xref:manual/status-logger.adoc[] to report exceptions that occur in appenders.
This behavior can be changed using the following configuration property:

[#ignoreExceptions]
==== `ignoreExceptions`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Type          | `boolean`
| Default value | `true`
|===

If `false` logging exceptions will be forwarded to the caller.
Otherwise, they will be logged using xref:manual/status-logger.adoc[].

[TIP]
====
If logging is important for your business, consider using a
xref:manual/appenders/delegating.adoc#FailoverAppender[`Failover` Appender]
to redirect log events to a different appender in case of exceptions.
====

[#runtime-evaluation]
=== Runtime evaluation of attributes

The following configuration attributes are also evaluated at runtime, so can contain escaped `$$+{...}+` property substitution expressions.

.List of attributes evaluated at runtime
[cols="1,1,1,1"]

The
xref:manual/appenders/delegating.adoc#Route[`Route`]
component of the
xref:manual/appenders/delegating.adoc#RoutingAppender[Routing Appender]
is special: its children are evaluated at runtime, but they are **not** evaluated at configuration time.
Inside the `Route` component you **should not** use escaped `$$+{...}+` property substitution expressions, but only unescaped `$+{...}+` property substitution expressions.

See xref:manual/configuration.adoc#lazy-property-substitution[runtime property substitution] for more details.

[#collection]
== Collection

Log4j bundles several predefined appenders to assist in several common deployment use cases.
They are documented in separate pages based on their target resource:

[#file-appenders]
=== File appenders

File appenders write logs to the filesystem.
They can be further split into:

Single file appenders:::
See xref:manual/appenders/file.adoc[] for details.

Rolling file appenders:::
See xref:manual/appenders/rolling-file.adoc[] for details.

[#database-appenders]
=== Database appenders

The appenders write log events directly to a database.

xref:manual/appenders/database.adoc#CassandraAppender[Cassandra appender]::
Sends log events to
https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html[Apache Cassandra]

xref:manual/appenders/database.adoc#JdbcAppender[JDBC appender]::
Sends log events to a JDBC driver

xref:manual/appenders/database.adoc#JpaAppender[JPA appender]::
Uses Jakarta Persistence API to deliver log events to a database

xref:manual/appenders/database.adoc#NoSqlAppender[NoSQL appender]::
Store log events to a document-oriented database

See xref:manual/appenders/database.adoc[] for details.

[#delegating-appenders]
=== Delegating appenders

Delegating appenders are intended to decorate other appenders:

xref:manual/appenders/delegating.adoc#AsyncAppender[Asynchronous appender]::
Perform all I/O on a dedicated thread

xref:manual/appenders/delegating.adoc#FailoverAppender[Failover appender]::
Provide a backup appender in case an appender fails

xref:manual/appenders/delegating.adoc#RewriteAppender[Rewrite appender]::
Modify log events prior to delivering them to the target

xref:manual/appenders/delegating.adoc#RoutingAppender[Routing appender]::
Dynamically choose a different appender for each log event

See xref:manual/appenders/delegating.adoc[] for details.

[id=consoleappender]
=== [[ConsoleAppender]] ConsoleAppender

As one might expect, the ConsoleAppender writes its output to either
`System.out` or `System.err` with `System.out` being the default target.
A Layout must be provided to format the LogEvent.

.ConsoleAppender Parameters
[cols="20%,20%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter Name |Type |Description
|filter |Filter |A Filter to determine if the event should be handled by
this Appender. More than one Filter may be used by using a
CompositeFilter.

|layout |Layout |The Layout to use to format the LogEvent. If no layout
is supplied the default pattern layout of "%m%n" will be used.

|follow |boolean |Identifies whether the appender honors reassignments
of `System.out` or `System.err` via `System.setOut` or `System.setErr` made
after configuration. Note that the follow attribute cannot be used with
Jansi on Windows. Cannot be used with `direct`.

|direct |boolean |Write directly to `java.io.FileDescriptor` and bypass
`java.lang.System.out/.err`. Can give up to 10x performance boost when
the output is redirected to a file or other process. Cannot be used with
Jansi on Windows. Cannot be used with `follow`. The output will not respect
`java.lang.System.setOut()/.setErr()` and may get intertwined with other
output to `java.lang.System.out/.err` in a multi-threaded application.
_New since 2.6.2. Be aware that this is a new addition, and it has only
been tested with Oracle JVM on Linux and Windows so far._

|name |String |The name of the Appender.

|ignoreExceptions |boolean |The default is `true`, causing exceptions
encountered while appending events to be internally logged and then
ignored. When set to `false` exceptions will be propagated to the
caller, instead. You must set this to `false` when wrapping this
Appender in a <<FailoverAppender>>.

|target |String |Either "SYSTEM_OUT" or "SYSTEM_ERR". The default is
"SYSTEM_OUT".
|=======================================================================

A typical Console configuration might look like:

[source,xml,prettyprint,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="warn" name="MyApp">
  <Appenders>
    <Console name="STDOUT" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
      <PatternLayout pattern="%m%n"/>
    </Console>
  </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    <Root level="error">
      <AppenderRef ref="STDOUT"/>
    </Root>
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>
----

[#FlumeAppender]
=== FlumeAppender

_This is an optional component supplied in a separate jar._

https://flume.apache.org/index.html[Apache Flume] is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data from many different sources to a centralized data store.
The FlumeAppender takes LogEvents and sends them to a Flume agent as serialized Avro events for consumption.

The Flume Appender supports three modes of operation.

1. It can act as a remote Flume client which sends Flume events via Avro to a Flume Agent configured with an Avro Source.
2. It can act as an embedded Flume Agent where Flume events pass directly into Flume for processing.
3. It can persist events to a local BerkeleyDB data store and then asynchronously send the events to Flume, similar to the embedded Flume Agent but without most of the Flume dependencies.

Usage as an embedded agent will cause the messages to be directly passed to the Flume Channel and then control will be immediately returned to the application.
All interaction with remote agents will occur asynchronously.
Setting the "type" attribute to "Embedded" will force the use of the embedded agent.
In addition, configuring agent properties in the appender configuration will also cause the embedded agent to be used.

.FlumeAppender Parameters
[width="100%",cols="20%,20%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter Name |Type |Description
|agents |Agent[] |An array of Agents to which the logging events should
be sent. If more than one agent is specified the first Agent will be the
primary and subsequent Agents will be used in the order specified as
secondaries should the primary Agent fail. Each Agent definition
supplies the Agent's host and port. The specification of agents and
properties are mutually exclusive. If both are configured an error will
result.

|agentRetries |integer |The number of times the agent should be retried
before failing to a secondary. This parameter is ignored when
`type="persistent"` is specified (agents are tried once before failing to
the next).

|batchSize |integer |Specifies the number of events that should be sent
as a batch. The default is 1. _This parameter only applies to the Flume
Appender._

|compress |boolean |When set to true the message body will be compressed
using gzip

|connectTimeoutMillis |integer |The number of milliseconds Flume will
wait before timing out the connection.

|dataDir |String |Directory where the Flume write-ahead log should be
written. Valid only when embedded is set to true and Agent elements are
used instead of Property elements.

|filter |Filter |A Filter to determine if the event should be handled by
this Appender. More than one Filter may be used by using a
CompositeFilter.

|eventPrefix |String |The character string to prepend to each event
attribute to distinguish it from MDC attributes. The default is
an empty string.

|flumeEventFactory |FlumeEventFactory |Factory that generates the Flume
events from Log4j events. The default factory is the FlumeAvroAppender
itself.

|layout |Layout |The Layout to use to format the LogEvent. If no layout
is specified RFC5424Layout will be used.

|lockTimeoutRetries |integer |The number of times to retry if a
LockConflictException occurs while writing to Berkeley DB. The default
is 5.

|maxDelayMillis |integer |The maximum number of milliseconds to wait for
batchSize events before publishing the batch.

|mdcExcludes |String |A comma-separated list of mdc keys that should be
excluded from the FlumeEvent. This is mutually exclusive with the
mdcIncludes attribute.

|mdcIncludes |String |A comma-separated list of mdc keys that should be
included in the FlumeEvent. Any keys in the MDC not found in the list
will be excluded. This option is mutually exclusive with the mdcExcludes
attribute.

|mdcRequired |String |A comma-separated list of `mdc` keys that must be
present in the MDC. If a key is not present a LoggingException will be
thrown.

|mdcPrefix |String |A string that should be prepended to each MDC key to distinguish it from event attributes. The default string is
"mdc:".

|name |String |The name of the Appender.

|properties |Property[] a|
One or more Property elements that are used to configure the Flume
Agent. The properties must be configured without the agent name (the
appender name is used for this) and no sources can be configured.
Interceptors can be specified for the source using
"sources.log4j-source.interceptors". All other Flume configuration
properties are allowed. Specifying both Agent and Property elements will
result in an error.

When used to configure in Persistent mode the valid properties are:

1. `keyProvider` to specify the name of the plugin to provide the
secret key for encryption.

|requestTimeoutMillis |integer |The number of milliseconds Flume will
wait before timing out the request.

|ignoreExceptions |boolean |The default is `true`, causing exceptions
encountered while appending events to be internally logged and then
ignored. When set to `false` exceptions will be propagated to the
caller, instead. You must set this to `false` when wrapping this
Appender in a <<FailoverAppender>>.

|type |enumeration |One of "Avro", "Embedded", or "Persistent" to
indicate which variation of the Appender is desired.

[#jms-appender]
=== [[JMSAppender]]JMS Appender

The JMS Appender sends the formatted log event to a JMS Destination.

The JMS Appender requires JNDI support so as of release 2.17.0, this appender will not function unless `log4j2.enableJndiJms=true` is configured as a system property or environment variable.
See the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#enableJndiJms[enableJndiJms] system property.

Note that in Log4j 2.0, this appender was split into a JMSQueueAppender and a JMSTopicAppender.
Starting in Log4j 2.1, these appenders were combined into the JMS Appender, which makes no distinction between queues and topics.
However, configurations written for 2.0 that use the `<JMSQueue/>` or `<JMSTopic/>` elements will continue to work with the new `<JMS/>` configuration element.

.JMS Appender Parameters
[cols="1,1,1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter Name | Type | Default | Description

| factoryBindingName
| String
| _Required_
| The name to locate in the Context that provides the
https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/8/apidocs/javax/jms/connectionfactory[ConnectionFactory].
This can be any subinterface of `ConnectionFactory` as well.

| factoryName
| String
| _Required_
| The fully qualified class name that should be used to define the Initial Context Factory as defined in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY[`INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY`]. If a `factoryName` is specified without a `providerURL`, a warning message will be logged as this is likely to cause problems.

| filter
| Filter
| null
| A Filter to determine if the event should be handled by this Appender. More than one Filter may be used by using a CompositeFilter.

| layout
| Layout
| _Required_
| The Layout to use to format the LogEvent. _New since 2.9, in previous versions SerializedLayout was default._

| name
| String
| _Required_
| The name of the Appender.

| password
| String
| null
| The password to use to create the JMS connection.

| providerURL
| String
| _Required_
| The URL of the provider to use as defined by https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#PROVIDER_URL[PROVIDER_URL]. From Log4j 2.17, only the `java:` protocol is supported.

| destinationBindingName
| String
| _Required_
| The name to use to locate the
https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/8/apidocs/javax/jms/destination[Destination].
This can be a `Queue` or `Topic`, and as such, the attribute names `queueBindingName` and `topicBindingName` are aliases to maintain compatibility with the Log4j 2.0 JMS appenders.

| securityPrincipalName
| String
| null
| The name of the identity of the Principal as specified by https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#SECURITY_PRINCIPAL[SECURITY_PRINCIPAL]. If a securityPrincipalName is specified without `securityCredentials`, a warning message will be logged as this is likely to cause problems.

| securityCredentials
| String
| null
| The security credentials for the principal as specified by https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#SECURITY_CREDENTIALS[SECURITY_CREDENTIALS].

| ignoreExceptions
| boolean
| true
| When `true`, exceptions caught while appending events are internally logged and then ignored. When `false` exceptions are propagated to the caller. You must set this to `false` when wrapping this Appender in a FailoverAppender.

| immediateFail
| boolean
| false
| When set to true, log events will not wait to try to reconnect and will fail immediately if the JMS resources are not available. New in 2.9.

| reconnectIntervalMillis
| long
| 5000
| If set to a value greater than 0, after an error, the JMSManager will attempt to reconnect to the broker after waiting the specified number of milliseconds. If the reconnect fails then an exception will be thrown (which can be caught by the application if `ignoreExceptions` is set to `false`). New in 2.9.

| urlPkgPrefixes
| String
| null
| A colon-separated list of package prefixes for the class name of the factory class that will create a URL context factory as defined by https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#URL_PKG_PREFIXES[URL_PKG_PREFIXES].

| userName
| String
| null
| The user ID used to create the JMS connection.

The HttpAppender sends log events over HTTP.
A Layout must be provided to format the LogEvent.

It will set the `Content-Type` header according to the layout.
Additional headers can be specified with embedded Property elements.

It will also wait for a response from the server, and throw an error if no 2xx response is received.

Implemented with
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html[`HttpURLConnection`].

[[KafkaAppender]]
=== KafkaAppender

The KafkaAppender logs events to an https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka] topic.
Each log event is sent as a Kafka record.

[cols="1m,1m,5"]
|===
|Parameter Name |Type |Description

|topic
|String
|The Kafka topic to use. Required.

|[[KafkaAppender-attr-key]]key
|String
|The key that will be sent to Kafka with every message.

Supports
xref:manual/configuration.adoc#lazy-property-substitution[runtime property substitution]
and is evaluated in the
xref:manual/lookups.adoc#event-context[_context of the current event_].

|filter
|Filter
|A Filter to determine if the event should be handled by this Appender. More than one Filter may be used by using a CompositeFilter.

|layout
|Layout
|The Layout to use to format the LogEvent. Required, there is no default. _New since 2.9, in previous versions `<PatternLayout pattern="%m"/>` was default._

|name
|String
|The name of the Appender. Required.

|ignoreExceptions
|boolean
|The default is `true`, causing exceptions encountered while appending events to be internally logged and then ignored. When set to `false` exceptions will be propagated to the caller, instead. You must set this to `false` when wrapping this Appender in a <<FailoverAppender>>.

|syncSend
|boolean
|The default is `true`, causing sends to block until the record has been acknowledged by the Kafka server. When set to `false`, sends a return immediately, allowing for lower latency and significantly higher throughput. _New since 2.8. Be aware that this is a new addition, and it has not been extensively tested.
Any failure sending to Kafka will be reported as an error to xref:manual/status-logger.adoc[] and the log event will be dropped (the ignoreExceptions parameter will not be effective).
Log events may arrive out of order on the Kafka server._

|properties
|Property[]
|You can set properties in https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#producerconfigs[Kafka producer properties]. You need to set the `bootstrap.servers` property, there are sensible default values for the others. Do not set the `value.serializer` nor `key.serializer` properties.
|===

Here is a sample KafkaAppender configuration snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration>
  <!-- ... -->
  <Appenders>
    <Kafka name="Kafka" topic="log-test">
      <PatternLayout pattern="%date %message"/>
      <Property name="bootstrap.servers">localhost:9092</Property>
    </Kafka>
  </Appenders>
  <!-- ... -->
</Configuration>
----

This appender is synchronous by default and will block until the record has been acknowledged by the Kafka server, timeout for this can be set with the `timeout.ms` property (defaults to 30 seconds).
Wrap with https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders.html#AsyncAppender[Async appender] and/or set syncSend to `false` to log asynchronously.

This appender requires the https://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka client library].
Note that you need to use a version of the Kafka client library matching the Kafka server used.

_Note:_ Make sure to not let `org.apache.kafka` log to a Kafka appender on DEBUG level, since that will cause recursive logging:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration>
  <!-- ... -->
  <Loggers>
    <Root level="DEBUG">
      <AppenderRef ref="Kafka"/>

    <Logger name="org.apache.kafka" level="INFO" /> <!-- avoid recursive logging -->
  </Loggers>
  <!-- ... -->
</Configuration>

[#servlet-appender]
=== Servlet appender

The servlet appender allows users to forward all logging calls to the
https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/servletcontext#log(java.lang.String,java.lang.Throwable)[`ServletContext.log()`]
methods.
You can use it by declaring an appender of type `Servlet` in your configuration file:

----
====

<1> Encodes events using xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc[] and forwards the call to
`ServletContext.log()`.
Setting `alwaysWriteExceptions` to `false` prevents the stacktrace from appearing as both part of the `message` argument and as `throwable` argument:
this usually results in the stacktrace being printed to the log file twice.

Additional runtime dependencies are required for using the servlet appender:

include::partial$manual/dependencies-log4j-jakarta-web.adoc[]

See xref:jakarta.adoc[] for more information.

[CAUTION]
====
The `ServletContext.log(String, Throwable)` method predates modern logging APIs.
By using Servlet appender you typically will not be able to differentiate log events by log level or logger name.
====

[[SMTPAppender]]
=== SMTPAppender

Sends an e-mail when a specific logging event occurs, typically on errors or fatal errors.

The number of logging events delivered in this e-mail depends on the value of the `BufferSize` option.
The `SMTPAppender` keeps only the last `BufferSize` logging events in its cyclic buffer.
This keeps memory requirements at a reasonable level while still delivering useful application context.
All events in the buffer are included in the email.
The buffer will contain the most recent events of level TRACE to WARN preceding the event that triggered the email.

The default behavior is to trigger sending an email whenever an ERROR or higher severity event is logged and to format it as HTML.
The circumstances of when the email is sent can be controlled by setting one or more filters on the Appender.
As with other Appenders, the formatting can be controlled by specifying a Layout for the Appender.

[#SocketAppender]
=== SocketAppender

The `SocketAppender` is an OutputStreamAppender that writes its output to a remote destination specified by a host and port.
The data can be sent over either TCP or UDP and can be sent in any format.
You can optionally secure communication with <<SSL>>.
Note that the TCP and SSL variants write to the socket as a stream and do not expect a response from the target destination.
Due to limitations in the TCP protocol that means that when the target server closes its connection some log events may continue to appear to succeed until a closed connection exception is raised, causing those events to be lost.
If guaranteed delivery is required a protocol that requires acknowledgments must be used.

.`SocketAppender` Parameters
[cols="20%,20%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter Name |Type |Description
|name |String |The name of the Appender.

|host |String |The name or address of the system that is listening for
log events. This parameter is required.

|port |integer |The port on the host that is listening for log events.
This parameter must be specified. If the hostname resolves to multiple
IP addresses the TCP and SSL variations will fail over to the next IP
address when a connection is lost.

|protocol |String |"TCP" (default), "SSL" or "UDP".

|SSL |SslConfiguration |Contains the configuration for the KeyStore and
TrustStore. See <<SSL>>.

|filter |Filter |A Filter to determine if the event should be handled by
this Appender. More than one Filter may be used by using a
CompositeFilter.

|immediateFail |boolean |When set to true, log events will not wait to
try to reconnect and will fail immediately if the socket is not
available.

|immediateFlush |boolean |When set to true - the default, each write
will be followed by a flush. This will guarantee the data is written to
disk but could impact performance.

|bufferedIO |boolean |When true - the default, events are written to a
buffer and the data will be written to the socket when the buffer is
full or, if immediateFlush is set when the record is written.

|bufferSize |int |When bufferedIO is true, this is the buffer size, the
default is 8192 bytes.

|layout |Layout |The Layout to use to format the LogEvent. Required,
there is no default. _New since 2.9, in previous versions
SerializedLayout was the default._

|reconnectionDelayMillis |integer |If set to a value greater than 0,
after an error, the SocketManager will attempt to reconnect to the server
after waiting for the specified number of milliseconds. If the reconnect
fails then an exception will be thrown (which can be caught by the
application if `ignoreExceptions` is set to `false`).

|connectTimeoutMillis |integer |The connect timeout in milliseconds. The
default is 0 (infinite timeout, like `Socket.connect()` methods).

|ignoreExceptions |boolean |The default is `true`, causing exceptions
encountered while appending events to be internally logged and then
ignored. When set to `false` exceptions will be propagated to the
caller, instead. You must set this to `false` when wrapping this
Appender in a <<FailoverAppender>>.

advertised.

|appName |String |The value to use as the APP-NAME in the RFC 5424
syslog record.

|charset |String |The character set to use when converting the Syslog
String to a byte array. The String must be a valid
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html[`Charset`].
If not specified, the default system Charset will be used.

|connectTimeoutMillis |integer |The connect timeout in milliseconds. The
default is 0 (infinite timeout, like `Socket.connect()` methods).

|enterpriseNumber |integer |The IANA enterprise number as described in
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424#section-7.2.2[RFC 5424]

|filter |Filter |A Filter to determine if the event should be handled by
this Appender. More than one Filter may be used by using a
CompositeFilter.

|facility |String |The facility is used to try to classify the message.
The facility option must be set to one of "KERN", "USER", "MAIL",
"DAEMON", "AUTH", "SYSLOG", "LPR", "NEWS", "UUCP", "CRON", "AUTHPRIV",
"FTP", "NTP", "AUDIT", "ALERT", "CLOCK", "LOCAL0", "LOCAL1", "LOCAL2",

specified as upper or lowercase characters.

|format |String |If set to "RFC5424" the data will be formatted by RFC 5424.
Otherwise, it will be formatted as a BSD
Syslog record. Note that although BSD Syslog records are required to be
1024 bytes or shorter the SyslogLayout does not truncate them. The
RFC5424Layout also does not truncate records since the receiver must
accept records of up to 2048 bytes and may accept longer records.

|host |String |The name or address of the system that is listening for
log events. This parameter is required.

|id |String |The default structured data-id to use when formatting
according to RFC 5424. If the LogEvent contains a StructuredDataMessage
the id from the Message will be used instead of this value.

|ignoreExceptions |boolean |The default is `true`, causing exceptions
encountered while appending events to be internally logged and then
ignored. When set to `false` exceptions will be propagated to the
caller, instead. You must set this to `false` when wrapping this
Appender in a <<FailoverAppender>>.

|immediateFail |boolean |When set to true, log events will not wait to
try to reconnect and will fail immediately if the socket is not
available.

|immediateFlush |boolean |When set to true - the default, each write
will be followed by a flush. This will guarantee the data is written to
disk but could impact performance.

|includeMDC |boolean |Indicates whether data from the ThreadContextMap
will be included in the RFC 5424 Syslog record. Defaults to true.

|Layout |Layout |A custom layout that overrides the `format` setting.

|loggerFields |List of KeyValuePairs |Allows arbitrary PatternLayout
patterns to be included as specified ThreadContext fields; no default
specified. To use, include a `LoggerFields` nested element, containing
one or more `KeyValuePair` elements. Each `KeyValuePair` must have a key
attribute, which specifies the key name that will be used to identify
the field within the MDC Structured Data element, and a value attribute,
which specifies the PatternLayout pattern to use as the value.

|mdcExcludes |String |A comma-separated list of mdc keys that should be
excluded from the LogEvent. This is mutually exclusive with the
mdcIncludes attribute. This attribute only applies to RFC 5424 syslog
records.

|mdcIncludes |String |A comma-separated list of mdc keys that should be
included in the FlumeEvent. Any keys in the MDC not found in the list
will be excluded. This option is mutually exclusive with the mdcExcludes
attribute. This attribute only applies to RFC 5424 syslog records.

|mdcRequired |String |A comma-separated list of `mdc` keys that must be
present in the MDC. If a key is not present a LoggingException will be
thrown. This attribute only applies to RFC 5424 syslog records.

RFC 5424 syslog records.

|name |String |The name of the Appender.

|newLine |boolean |If true, a newline will be appended to the end of the
syslog record. The default is false.

|port |integer |The port on the host that is listening for log events.
This parameter must be specified.

|protocol |String |"TCP" or "UDP". This parameter is required.

|SSL |SslConfiguration |Contains the configuration for the KeyStore and
TrustStore. See <<SSL>>.

|reconnectionDelayMillis |integer |If set to a value greater than 0,
after an error, the SocketManager will attempt to reconnect to the server
after waiting for the specified number of milliseconds. If the reconnect
fails then an exception will be thrown (which can be caught by the
application if `ignoreExceptions` is set to `false`).

== Extending

Appenders are xref:manual/plugins.adoc[plugins] implementing link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/Appender.html[the `Appender` interface].
This section will guide you on how to create custom ones.

[WARNING]
====
*Implementing a reliable and efficient appender is a difficult task!*
We strongly advise you to

. Use existing appenders and/or managers whenever appropriate
. Share your use case and ask for feedback in a {logging-services-url}/support.html[user support channel]

[#extending-appenders]
=== Extending appenders

Appenders are xref:manual/plugins.adoc[plugins] implementing link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/Appender.html[the `Appender` interface].
We recommend users to extend from link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/appender/AbstractAppender.html[`AbstractAppender`], which provides implementation convenience.
While annotating your appender with `@Plugin`, you need to make sure that

* It has a unique `name` attribute across all available `Appender` plugins
* The `category` attribute is set to link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/config/Node.html#CATEGORY[`Node.CATEGORY`]

Most appender implementation use *managers*, which model an abstraction owning the resources, such as an `OutputStream` or a socket.
When a reconfiguration occurs a new appender will be created.
However, if nothing significant in the previous manager has changed, the new appender will simply reference it instead of creating a new one.
This ensures that events are not lost while a reconfiguration is taking place without requiring that logging pause while the reconfiguration takes place.
You are strongly advised to study the manager concept in <<collection,the predefined appenders>>, and either use an existing manager, or create your own.

You can check out following files for examples:

* {project-github-url}/log4j-core/src/main/java/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/appender/HttpAppender.java[`HttpAppender.java`] – <<HttpAppender>> sends log events over HTTP using `HttpURLConnectionManager`
* {project-github-url}/log4j-core/src/main/java/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/appender/ConsoleAppender.java[`ConsoleAppender.java`] – <<ConsoleAppender>> writes log events to either `System.out` or `System.err` using `OutputStreamManager`
