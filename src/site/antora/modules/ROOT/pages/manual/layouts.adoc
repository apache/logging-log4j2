= Layouts

An xref:manual/appenders.adoc[appender] uses a *layout* to encode a link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/LogEvent.html[`LogEvent`] into a form that meets the needs of whatever will be consuming the log event.
Layouts can encode this data into a `String`, a `byte[]`, or to a `ByteBufferDestination`.
Layouts used to support encoding data into an arbitrary `java.io.Serializable` classes in Log4j 2.x, but due to security concerns, this is no longer directly supported by layouts in Log4j 3.0.
This page will try to answer following questions:

* <<concerns,What are some common concerns shared by all predefined layouts?>>
* <<collection,Which layouts does Log4j provide?>>
* <<extending,How can you create custom layouts?>>

[#concerns]
== Common concerns

This section introduces you to some common concerns shared by almost all <<collection,predefined layouts>> that you need to be aware of while using them.

[#structured-logging]
=== Structured logging

include::partial$manual/structured-logging.adoc[]

Log4j strives to provide top of the class support for structured logging.
To create an end-to-end experience, it provides several {log4j2-url}/manual/messages.html#collection-structured[structured message types] along with layouts supporting structured logging.

We recommend xref:manual/json-template-layout.adoc[] for structured logging purposes.

[#charset]
=== Character encoding

All <<collection,predefined layouts>> produce `String` that eventually get converted into a `byte` using the
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/charset/Charset.html[`Charset`]
configured.
While doing so, unless an explicit encoding configuration is stated, they use `UTF-8` by default.
If you want all your log events to be formatted in a certain character encoding that is different from what the employed layout defaults to, make sure to configure the layout's character encoding as needed.

[#LocationInformation]
=== Location information

include::partial$manual/layouts-location-information.adoc[]

[#collection]
== Collection

Log4j bundles predefined layouts to assist in several common deployment use cases.
Let's start with shortcuts to most used ones:

* Are you looking for a production-grade *JSON layout ready to be deployed to a log ingestion system* such as Elasticsearch or Google Cloud?
Refer to xref:manual/json-template-layout.adoc[].

* Are you looking for a layout that encodes log events in a *human-readable format suitable for tests and local development*?
Refer to xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc[].

Following sections explain all predefined layouts in detail.

xref:plugin-reference.adoc#org-apache-logging-log4j_log4j-core_org-apache-logging-log4j-core-Layout[ðŸ“– Plugin reference for all `Layout` implementations]

[#csv-layouts]
=== [[CSVLayouts]] CSV Layouts

There are two layouts performing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values[Comma Separated Value (CSV)] encoding:

[#csv-layout-parameter]
==== CSV Parameter Layout

`CsvParameterLayout` encodes *only* the parameters of the message of a log event.
Generated CSV records will be composed of fields denoting the message parameters.

xref:plugin-reference.adoc#org-apache-logging-log4j_log4j-core_org-apache-logging-log4j-core-layout-CsvParameterLayout[ðŸ“– Plugin reference for `CsvParameterLayout`]

.Click here for examples
[%collapsible]
====
Given the following statement

[source,java]
----
LOGGER.info("Record1 {} {}", "arg1", "arg2");
LOGGER.error("Record2 {} {} {}", "arg3", "arg4", "arg5", throwable);
----

`CsvParameterLayout` will output

[source,text]
----
arg1,arg2
arg3,arg4,arg5
----

The same can be achieved using link:../javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/ObjectArrayMessage.html[`ObjectArrayMessage`] as follows:

[source,java]
----
LOGGER.info(new ObjectArrayMessage("arg1", "arg2"));
LOGGER.info(new ObjectArrayMessage("arg3", "arg4", "arg5"));
----
====

[#csv-layout-log-event]
==== CSV Log Event Layout

`CsvLogEventLayout` encodes the complete log event, including the formatted message.
Generated CSV records will be composed of following fields in the given order:

. Time (in nanoseconds)
. Time (in milliseconds)
. Level
. Thread ID
. Thread name
. Thread priority
. Message (formatted, hence including parameters)
. Logger FQCN
. Logger name
. Marker
. Throwable
. Source
. Thread context map
. Thread context stack

[#HTMLLayout]
=== HTML Layout

`HtmlLayout` generates an HTML page, and adds each log event to a row in a table.

xref:plugin-reference.adoc#org-apache-logging-log4j_log4j-core_org-apache-logging-log4j-core-layout-HtmlLayout[ðŸ“– Plugin reference for `HtmlLayout`]

It is configured with the following parameters:

[%header,cols="1m,1m,4"]
|===
|Parameter
|Type
|Description

|charset
|String
|The character encoding

|contentType
|String
|The `Content-Type` header value (defaults to `text/html`)

|datePattern
|String
|The date format of the log event.
The default is `JVM_ELAPSE_TIME`, which outputs the milliseconds since JVM started.
For other valid values, refer to xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#converter-date[the `date` conversion specifier of Pattern Layout].

|fontName
|String
|The `font-family` (defaults to `arial,sans-serif`)

If not specified, this layout uses the
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TimeZone.html#getDefault()[`TimeZone.getDefault()`]
as the default.
You can use time zone IDs supported by
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TimeZone.html#getTimeZone(java.lang.String)[`TimeZone.getTimeZone(String)`].

|title
|String
|The HTML page title
|===

[#JSONTemplateLayout]
=== JSON Template Layout

`JsonTemplateLayout` is a customizable, efficient, and garbage-free JSON generating layout.
It encodes ``LogEvent``s according to the structure described by the JSON template provided.

For instance, given the following event template stored in `MyLayout.json` in your classpath:

[source,json]
----
{
  "instant": { // <1>
    "$resolver": "timestamp",
    "pattern": {
      "format": "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'",
      "timeZone": "UTC"
    }
  },
  "someConstant": 1, // <2>
  "message": { // <3>
    "$resolver": "message",
    "stringified": true
  }
}
----
<1> Using the `timestamp` event template resolver to populate the `instant` field
<2> Passing a constant that will be rendered as is
<3> Using the `message` event template resolver to populate the `message` field

in combination with the below layout configuration:

JSON Template Layout generates JSON as follows:

[source,json]
----
{"instant":"2017-05-25T19:56:23.370Z","someConstant":1,"message":"Hello, error!"} //<1>
----
<1> JSON pretty-printing is not supported for performance reasons.

Good news is JSON Template Layout is perfectly production-ready without any configuration!
It bundles several predefined event templates modeling popular JSON-based log formats.

[#MessageLayout]
=== Message Layout

`MessageLayout` is a special layout that extracts the
{log4j2-url}/manual/messages.html[`Message`]
contained in a log event.
It is currently only useful with the
xref:manual/appenders/database.adoc#JdbcAppender[JDBC Appender].

xref:plugin-reference.adoc#org-apache-logging-log4j_log4j-core_org-apache-logging-log4j-core-layout-MessageLayout[{plugin-reference-marker} Plugin reference for `MessageLayout`]

[id=pattern-layout]
=== [[PatternLayout]] Pattern Layout

`PatternLayout` is a customizable, efficient, garbage-free, and human-readable string generating layout using a user-provided pattern.
It is analogous to `String#format()` with specialized directives on injecting certain properties of a `LogEvent`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Pattern Layout is not intended for _structural logging_ purposes.
For production environments, you are strongly advised to use xref:manual/json-template-layout.adoc[] producing JSON output ready to be delivered to log ingestion systems such as Elasticsearch or Google Cloud Logging.
====

A conversion pattern is composed of literal text and format control expressions.
For instance, given the `%-5p [%t]: %m%n` pattern, following statements

[source,java]
----
LOGGER.debug("Message 1");
LOGGER.warn("Message 2");
----

will yield the output

[source,text]
----
DEBUG [main]: Message 1
WARN  [main]: Message 2
----

RFC 5424 Layout has specialized handling for {log4j2-url}/manual/messages.html#StructuredDataMessage[`StructuredDataMessage`]s.
By combining two, users can have complete control on how their message is encoded in a way compliant with RFC 5424, while RFC 5424 Layout will make sure the rest of the information attached to the log event is properly injected.

[#SyslogLayout]
=== Syslog Layout

`SyslogLayout` encodes log events according to https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3164#section-4.1[the syslog message format described in RFC 3164].
This matches the same format used by {logging-services-url}/log4j/1.x[Log4j 1].

[IMPORTANT]
====
RFC 3164, implemented by Syslog Layout, is obsoleted by RFC 5424, implemented by <<RFC5424Layout>>.

[#extending]
== Extending

Layouts are xref:manual/plugins.adoc[plugins] implementing link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/Layout.html[the `Layout` interface].
This section will guide you on how to create custom ones.

[NOTE]
====
While <<collection,the predefined layout collection>> should address most common use cases, you might find yourself needing to implement a custom one.
If this is the case, we really appreciate it if you can *share your use case in a {logging-services-url}/support.html[user support channel]*.

[#extending-layouts]
=== Extending layouts

Layouts are xref:manual/plugins.adoc[plugins] implementing link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/Layout.html[the `Layout` interface].
It is recommended you extend from link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/layout/AbstractStringLayout.html[`AbstractStringLayout`].
While annotating your layout with `@Plugin` and `@Configurable`, you need to make sure that

* The plugin name in `@Plugin::value` or the simple class name of the plugin if no custom name is given must be unique across all available `Layout` plugins.

You can check out following files for examples:

* {project-github-url}/log4j-core/src/main/java/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/layout/SyslogLayout.java[`SyslogLayout.java`] â€“ simple, single-file, extending from `AbstractStringLayout`
* {project-github-url}/log4j-layout-template-json/src/main/java/org/apache/logging/log4j/layout/template/json/JsonTemplateLayout.java[`JsonTemplateLayout.java`] â€“ advanced, using plugins for composing several of its features, contains _recycler_ concept for xref:manual/garbagefree.adoc[garbage-free] operation, extends from link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/StringLayout.html[`StringLayout`]
