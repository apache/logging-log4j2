= Lookups

Log4j Core provides a flexible and extensible property substitution system.

[#StrSubstitutor-diagram]
.Property substitution system
[plantuml]
....
@startuml
class StrSubstitutor #line.bold {
  Interpolator interpolator
  String replace(String input)
  String replace(LogEvent event, String input)
}

StrSubstitutor --> Interpolator

class Interpolator {
  StrLookup[] lookups
  String lookup(String key)
  String lookup(LogEvent event, String key)
}

Interpolator --> "0..*" StrLookup

class StrLookup {
  String lookup(String input)
  String lookup(LogEvent event, String key)
}

@enduml
....

The property substitution system is composed of these elements:

* A string interpolation engine (xref:manual/architecture.adoc#StrSubstitutor[`StrSubstitutor`]) that evaluates `$+{...}+` expressions.
These expressions can contain recursive expressions and default values.
+
See xref:manual/configuration.adoc#property-substitution[property substitution] for more details.

* The
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/Interpolator.html[`Interpolator`]
that evaluates simple `$\{name}` expressions.
+
The Interpolator has two functions:

** If `name` does not contain a colon `:` character, the Interpolator uses the
xref:manual/configuration.adoc#global-properties[`Properties` configuration element] to resolve its value.

** If `name` is of the form `prefix:key`, the Interpolator delegates the lookup to a `StrLookup` associated with `prefix` and falls back to evaluating `$+{key}+` if the lookup was not successful.

* A set of
xref:plugin-reference.adoc#org-apache-logging-log4j_log4j-core_org-apache-logging-log4j-core-lookup-StrLookup[`StrLookup`]
plugins, each one associated with a prefix, which retrieve data from external sources.

`StrLookup` is a simple map-like interface.
The main difference between a map and `StrLookup` is that the latter can compute the value of a key dynamically in a global context or in the context of log event.

[#common-concerns]
== Common concerns

[#evaluation-contexts]
=== Evaluation contexts

Each lookup has an associated prefix, and Log4j can evaluate it in one of the following ways:

[#global-context]
Global context::
In a global context Log4j evaluates `$+{prefix:key}+` expressions by calling
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/StrLookup.html#lookup(java.lang.String)[`lookup("key")`]
on the lookup associated to `prefix`.
The result of this call only takes into account the global state of the system.
+
The global context is used to expand the attributes of a
xref:manual/configuration.adoc[configuration file].

[#event-context]
Log event context::
In the context of a log event `event`, Log4j evaluates `$+{prefix:key}+` expressions by calling
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/StrLookup.html#lookup(org.apache.logging.log4j.core.LogEvent,java.lang.String)[`lookup(event, "key")`] on the lookup associated to `prefix`.
The result of this call might take into account the contents of the log event, besides the global state of the system.

Some configuration attributes (e.g., xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#plugin-attr-pattern[the `pattern` attribute of Pattern Layout]) supports both evaluation contexts:

* During the configuration process the `$+{...}+` expressions are evaluated using a global context.
The same process converts escaped `$$+{...}+` expressions to `$+{...}+` expressions.

* For each log event, the remaining expressions are evaluated, using the log event as context.

Lookups can choose to react differently depending on the execution context.
<<DateLookup>> is such an example:

* When used in a global context, it formats the **current** timestamp obtained through
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis--[`System.currentTimeMillis()`].
* When used in the context of an event, it formats the **event** timestamp obtained through
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/LogEvent.html#getTimeMillis()[`LogEvent.getTimeMillis()`].

[#lookups-patterns]
=== Lazy lookups and pattern converters

For historical reasons, the
xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#plugin-attr-pattern[`pattern` attribute of PatternLayout]
supports two similar string replacement mechanisms:

* `+${...}+` property expressions.
* xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#converters[`%<name>` pattern converters].

Both lazy `+$${...}+` property expressions and pattern converters have access to the value of the current `LogEvent` and can provide similar results.
There is, however, an important difference between them:

* Pattern converters can be garbage-free.
See xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#garbage-free[Garbage-free pattern converters] for more details.
* Lazy lookups are **not** garbage-free and always create temporary `String` objects.

[#collection]
== Collection

Log4j Core provides many lookups out-of-the-box:

Lookups operating on the global context:: A large group of lookups supports evaluation in a global context.
These lookups can be safely used in eagerly evaluated properties of a

[#ResourceBundleLookup]
=== Resource Bundle Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context | _global_

| Syntax
a| `bundle:<baseName>:<key>`

where:

`baseName`::
the base name of a resource bundle (see
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html[`ResourceBundle`]).

`key`::
the key for the resource string.
|===

The Resource Bundle Lookup retrieves strings from Java Resource bundles, e.g.:

----
${bundle:org.example.Main:errorMessage}
----

[TIP]
====
Do you want to use the values in Spring Boot's `application.properties` file?
Use <<SpringBootLookup>> or <<SpringBootLookup3>> instead.
====

[#ContextMapLookup]
=== Context Map Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context | _global_ and _log event_

| Syntax
| `ctx:<key>`

where `<key>` is any `String`.
|===

The Context Map Lookup can be used in two different contexts:

Global context::
If used in the global context, it uses the
xref:manual/thread-context.adoc[]
to retrieve data.
+
[WARNING]
====
When used in this context
xref:manual/thread-context.adoc#custom-ContextDataProvider[custom context data providers]
are not supported.
====

Log event context::
In the context of an event, the Context Map lookup uses the Log event
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/LogEvent.html#getContextData()[context map data]
of a log event to resolve the key.
xref:manual/thread-context.adoc#custom-ContextDataProvider[Custom context data providers] are therefore supported.
+
[TIP]
====
Don't use `$$+{ctx:key}+` in the xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc[] conversion patterns!
Use xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#converter-thread-context-map[the `%X\{key}` pattern converter] instead.

See <<lookups-patterns>> for more information.
====

[#DateLookup]
=== Date Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context | _global_ and _log event_

| Syntax
| `date:<format>`

where `<format>` is a
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[`SimpleDateFormat`] pattern

|===

The Date Lookup formats a timestamp, using the supplied key as format.
The timestamp used depends on the context:

Global context::
When used in a global context, the timestamp used is the current system timestamp as returned by
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis--[`System.currentTimeMillis()`].

Log event context::
When used in the context of a log event, the timestamp of the log event is used.
+
[TIP]
====
Don't use `$$+{date:format}+` in the xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc[] conversion patterns!
Use xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#converter-date[the `%d\{key}` pattern converter] instead.

See <<lookups-patterns>> for more information.
====

[#DockerLookup]
=== Docker Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context | _global_

| Syntax
| `docker:<key>`

where `<key>` is one of the <<DockerLookup-keys>>.
| Dependency
| xref:components.adoc#log4j-docker[`log4j-docker`]
|===

Docker Lookup queries https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/[the API of the Docker Engine] running your container.
It supports the retrieval of following container attributes:

Don't use `$$+{event:key}+` in the xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc[] conversion patterns!
There is a xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#converters[specialized pattern converter replacement] for each of these lookups.

See <<lookups-patterns>> for more information.
====

[#JavaLookup]
=== Java Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context    | _global_

| Syntax
| `java:<key>`

where `<key>` is one of the <<JavaLookup-keys>>.
|===

The Java Lookup allows retrieving information about the Java environment the application is using.
The following keys are supported

.Java Lookup supported keys
[cols="1m,2,6m",id=JavaLookup-keys]
|===
|Key |Description |Example

|version
|Short Java version

|===

[#JndiLookup]
=== JNDI Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context    | _global_

| Syntax
| `jndi:<name>`

where `<name>` is a JNDI https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/javax/naming/Name.html[`Name`].
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of Log4j `2.17.0` you need to enable the JNDI lookup **explicitly** by setting the
xref:manual/systemproperties.adoc#log4j2.enableJndiLookup[`log4j2.enableJndiLookup`]
configuration property to `true`.
====

The JNDI Lookup retrieves the value of an environment entry from JNDI.
Only the `java:` protocol is supported.
If the key does not have a protocol, `java:comp/env` is prepended.

As an example, to retrieve the value of `java:comp/env/app_name` you can use:

[source]
----
$${jndi:app_name}
----

[NOTE]
====
Android does not support JNDI.
====

[#Log4jLookup]
=== Configuration Location Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context    | _global_

| Syntax
| `log4j:<key>`

where `<key>` is one of the <<Log4jLookup-keys>>.
|===

The Configuration Location Lookup supports two keys:

.Configuration Location Lookup supported keys
[cols="1m,4",id=Log4jLookup-keys]
|===
|Key |Description

|configLocation
|Returns the location of the configuration file as an absolute file path or URI.

|configParentLocation
|Returns the location of the folder containing the configuration file as an absolute file path or URI.
|===

[#LowerLookup]
=== Lower Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context    | _global_

| Syntax
| `lower:<key>`

where `<key>` is any `String`.
|===

The Lower Lookup converts the passed in argument to lowercase.

Presumably, the value will be the result of a nested lookup as in the example:

[source]
----
${lower:${sys:appname}}
----

[#MainMapLookup]
=== Main Arguments Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context    | _global_

| Syntax
| `main:<key>`

wherre `<key>` either a non-negative `int` or a `String`.
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
This lookup requires a setup step:
your application needs to call
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/MainMapLookup.html#setMainArguments(java.lang.String...)[`MainMapLookup#setMainArguments()`]
and pass as argument the arguments received by the application.
====

The Main Arguments Lookup provides a way to query the arguments received by your application.
It supports two kinds of keys:

* if the key is an integer, e.g. `${main:0}`, it is interpreted as 0-based index in the argument array.
* if the key is a `String`, e.g. `${main:foo}`, the argument that follows `foo` in the argument array is returned.

.Lookup results for "foo bar baz" arguments
[cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| Lookup       | Expansion
| ${main:0}   | foo
| ${main:1}   | bar
| ${main:2}   | baz
| ${main:foo} | bar
| ${main:bar} | baz
|===

You can use this lookup to provide a primitive argument parsing mechanism to your application:

* First, you need to pass your application's arguments to the `MainMapLookup#setMainArguments` method:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$manual/lookups/MainArgsExample.java[tag=usage]
----
+
<1> Use an **instance** logger field instead of a static one, to prevent Log4j Core initialization before `main()` is called.
<2> Call `MainMapLookup#setMainArguments` by reflection to allow your application to run with a different Log4j API implementation.

* Now you can use `$+{main:...}+` lookups in your configuration file to support the usage of a `--logfile <file>` CLI argument to specify the log file and `--loglevel <level>` CLI argument to specify the log level.

[#MapLookup]
=== Map Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context    | _log event_

| Syntax
| `map:<key>`

where `<key>` is any `String`.
|===

The Map Lookup retrieves the value assigned to the given key in a
xref:manual/messages.adoc#MapMessage[`MapMessage`].

[TIP]
====
Don't use `$$+{map:key}+` in the xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc[] conversion patterns!
Use xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#converter-map[the `%K\{key}` pattern converter] instead.

See <<lookups-patterns>> for more information.
====

[#MarkerLookup]
=== Marker Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context    | _global_ or _log event_

| Syntax
| `marker:<key>`

where `<key>` is any `String`
|===

The Marker Lookup can be used in two different ways:

Global context::
When used in a global context, it returns `key` if there is a marker named `key` or `null` otherwise.
For example:
+
----
${marker:AUDIT:-NO_AUDIT}
----
+
will expand to `AUDIT` if a marker with that name exists or `NO_AUDIT` otherwise.

Log event context::
When used in the context of a log event, it returns the
link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/LogEvent.html[log event marker] if it exists.
+
[TIP]
====
Don't use `$$+{marker:}+` in the xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc[] conversion patterns!
Use xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#converter-marker[the `%markerSimpleName` pattern converter] instead.

See <<lookups-patterns>> for more information.
====

[#SpringBootLookup]
=== Spring Boot 2 Lookup

[cols="1h,4"]
|===
| Context    | _global_

| Syntax
| `spring:<key>`

where `<key>` is one of the <<SpringBootLookup-keys>>.

| Dependency | xref:log4j-spring-boot.adoc[]
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using Spring Boot 3, you should use the third party <<SpringBootLookup3>> instead.
====

The Spring Boot 2 Lookup allows user to query Spring Boot's
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html[externalized configuration files].
It supports the following keys:

.Spring Boot 2 Lookup supported keys
[cols="1m,4",id=SpringBootLookup-keys]
|===
|Key |Description

|profiles.active
|Comma-separated list of active profiles.

|profiles.active[<n>]
|The active profile with 0-based index `<n>`.

|profiles.default
|Comma-separated list of default profiles.

|profiles.default[<n>]
|The default profile with 0-based index `<n>`.

|<key>
|The value associated with `<key>` in Spring's
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html[`Environment`].
|===

[WARNING]
====
Spring Boot 2 initializes Log4j Core at least **twice**:

* Log4j Core is initialized the first time using
xref:manual/configuration.adoc#automatic-configuration[its own automatic configuration procedure].
At this point, the lookup will always return `null`.
Configuration files that use the standard `log4j2.<extension>` naming convention, should provide default values for all Spring lookups.

* As soon as Spring's `Environment` is ready, the lookup becomes **available** and a reconfiguration is triggered.
If you want to provide a configuration file specifically for this phase, call it `log4j2-spring.<extension>`.
====

Additional runtime dependencies are required for using Spring Boot Lookup:

Lookups are xref:manual/plugins.adoc[plugins] implementing link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/StrLookup.html[the `StrLookup` interface].
This section will guide you on how to create custom ones.

[NOTE]
====
While <<collection,the predefined lookup collection>> should address most common use cases, you might find yourself needing to implement a custom one.
If this is the case, we really appreciate it if you can *share your use case in a {logging-services-url}/support.html[user support channel]*.

=== Extending lookups

Lookups are xref:manual/plugins.adoc[plugins] implementing link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/StrLookup.html[the `StrLookup` interface].
While annotating your lookup with `@Plugin`, you need to make sure that

* It has a unique `name` attribute across all available `StrLookup` plugins
* The `category` attribute is set to link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/StrLookup.html#CATEGORY[`StrLookup.CATEGORY`]

You can check out the following files for examples:

* {project-github-url}/log4j-core/src/main/java/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/LowerLookup.java[`LowerLookup.java`] – <<LowerLookup>> lower-cases its input
* {project-github-url}/log4j-core/src/main/java/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/EventLookup.java[`EventLookup.java`] – <<EventLookup>> extracts specified fields from the effective `LogEvent` in the context
