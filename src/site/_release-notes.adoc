    IF THIS FILE IS CALLED `index.adoc`, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Release notes `index.adoc` is generated from `src/changelog/.index.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Edit `.index.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.index.adoc.ftl` and the generated `.index.adoc`
