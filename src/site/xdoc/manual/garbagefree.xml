        Different applications have different performance requirements.
        Some only need to worry about throughput, but for many
        the most important performance consideration is latency (response time).
        Users of such applications would consider it a serious problem
        if the system becomes unresponsive for more than a few seconds, or even milliseconds in some cases.
        In financial trading for example predictable low latency is so important that it is often considered
        worthwhile to trade off some throughput in return for a consistent response time.
      </p>
      -->
      <p>
        Garbage collection pauses are a common cause of latency spikes and for many systems
        significant effort is spent on controlling these pauses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many logging libraries, including previous versions of Log4j, allocate many temporary objects like
        log event objects, Strings, char arrays, byte arrays and more during steady state logging.
        This contributes to pressure on the garbage collector and increases the frequency with which GC pauses occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        From version 2.6, Log4j can be used in a "garbage free" mode where objects and buffers are reused
        and temporary object allocation is avoided as much as possible.

          To highlight the difference, we used Java Flight Recorder to measure a simple application that
          does nothing but log a simple string as often as possible for about 12 seconds.

        <p>
          The application was configured to use Async Loggers, a RandomAccessFile appender and a

          Mission Control shows that with Log4j 2.5 this application allocates memory at a rate of about 809 MB/sec,

          Log4j 2.6 does not allocate temporary objects in this configuration, and as a result
          the same application with Log4j 2.6 has a memory allocation rate of 1.6 MB/sec and had 0 (zero) garbage collections.

        <subsubsection name="Configuration">
          <h4>Configuration</h4>
          <p>
            In Log4j 2.6, garbage-free logging is enabled by default, except in web applications.
            Log4j will partially disable garbage-free logging if it detects that it is used in a web application
            (when the <tt>javax.servlet.Servlet</tt> class is in the classpath,
            or when system property <tt>log4j2.is.webapp</tt> is set to "true").
            This is because garbage-free logging uses a number of ThreadLocal fields, which can cause
            memory leaks when a thread pool of the web application server continues to hold references
            to these fields after the web application is undeployed. Log4j will not use these ThreadLocals
            to avoid memory leaks when used in web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some garbage-reducing functionality in Log4j is available for all applications:
            in Log4j 2.6, converting log events to text and text to bytes can be done by directly encoding text
            into a reused ByteBuffer without creating intermediary
            Strings, char arrays and byte arrays. This functionality does not rely on ThreadLocals and is
            enabled by default.
            So while logging is not completely garbage-free for web applications yet,
            the pressure on the garbage collector can still be significantly reduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two separate system properties for manually disabling the mechanisms Log4j uses to avoid
            creating temporary objects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><tt>log4j2.enable.threadlocals</tt> - if "true" (the default for non-web applications)
              objects are stored in ThreadLocal fields and reused, otherwise new
              objects are created for each log event</li>
            <li><tt>log4j2.enable.direct.encoders</tt> - if "true" (the default) log events are converted to text and this
              text is converted to bytes without creating temporary objects. Caution: multi-threaded applications
              that use synchronous logging may see worse performance: the lock that was previously only around the
              IO operation is widened to include the text formatting and conversion to bytes.
              </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Instead of system properties, the above properties can also be specified in a file named
            <tt>log4j2.component.properties</tt> by including this file in the classpath of the application.

          We made an effort to make logging code garbage-free without requiring code changes in existing applications,
          but there is one area where this was not possible.
          When logging primitive values (i.e. int, double, boolean, etc.) the JVM
          autoboxes these primitive values to their Object wrapper equivalents, creating garbage.

          Log4j provides an <tt>Unboxer</tt> utility to prevent autoboxing of primitive parameters.

          The <tt>Unboxer.box(primitive)</tt> methods write directly into a StringBuilder, and

          Custom Appenders that want to be garbage-free should provide their Layout with a
          <tt>ByteBufferDestination</tt> implementation that the Layout can directly write into.
        </p>
        <p>
          <tt>AbstractOutputStreamAppender</tt> has been modified to make the ConsoleAppender, (Rolling)FileAppender,
          (Rolling)RandomAccessFileAppender and MemoryMappedFileAppender garbage-free.
          An effort has been made to minimize impact on custom Appenders that extend
          <tt>AbstractOutputStreamAppender</tt>, but it is impossible to guarantee that changing the superclass
          will not impact any and all subclasses. Custom Appenders that extend
          <tt>AbstractOutputStreamAppender</tt> should verify that they still function correctly.
          In case there is a problem, system property <tt>log4j2.enable.direct.encoders</tt> can be set to "false"
          to revert to the pre-Log4j 2.6 behaviour.

          TODO Applications that wish to reuse custom Message instances with Async Loggers should let
          their Message classes implement the <tt>org.apache.logging.log4j.message.ReusableMessage</tt> interface.
          TODO This is not sufficient: see LOG4J2-1342, would be nice if we could solve this in a generic way.
