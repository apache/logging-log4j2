        Different applications have different performance requirements.
        Some only need to worry about throughput, but for many
        the most important performance consideration is latency (response time).
        Users of such applications would consider it a serious problem
        if the system becomes unresponsive for more than a few seconds, or even milliseconds in some cases.
        In financial trading for example predictable low latency is so important that it is often considered
        worthwhile to trade off some throughput in return for a consistent response time.
      </p>
      -->
      <p>
        Garbage collection pauses are a common cause of latency spikes and for many systems
        significant effort is spent on controlling these pauses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many logging libraries, including previous versions of Log4j, allocate temporary objects like
        log event objects, Strings, char arrays, byte arrays and more during steady state logging.
        This contributes to pressure on the garbage collector and increases the frequency with which GC pauses occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        From version 2.6, Log4j runs in "garbage free" mode by default ("low garbage" mode for web applications)
        where objects and buffers are reused and temporary object allocation is avoided as much as possible.
      </p>

        <p>
          To highlight the difference that garbage-free logging can make, we used Java Flight Recorder
          to measure a simple application that does nothing but log a simple string as often as possible
          for about 12 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application was configured to use Async Loggers, a RandomAccessFile appender and a
          "%d %p %c{1.} [%t] %m %ex%n" pattern layout. (Async Loggers used the Yield WaitStrategy.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Mission Control shows that with Log4j 2.5 this application allocates memory at a rate of about 809 MB/sec,
          resulting in 141 minor collections.
          Log4j 2.6 does not allocate temporary objects in this configuration, and as a result
          the same application with Log4j 2.6 has a memory allocation rate of 1.6 MB/sec and had 0 (zero) garbage collections.

          <p>
            In Log4j 2.6, garbage-free logging is enabled by default, except in web applications.
            Log4j will partially disable garbage-free logging if it detects that it is used in a web application
            (when the <tt>javax.servlet.Servlet</tt> class is in the classpath,
            or when system property <tt>log4j2.is.webapp</tt> is set to "true").
            This is because garbage-free logging uses a number of ThreadLocal fields, which can cause
            memory leaks when a thread pool of the web application server continues to hold references
            to these fields after the web application is undeployed. Log4j will not use these ThreadLocals
            to avoid memory leaks when used in web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some garbage-reducing functionality in Log4j is available for all applications:
            in Log4j 2.6, converting log events to text and text to bytes can be done by directly encoding text
            into a reused ByteBuffer without creating intermediary
            Strings, char arrays and byte arrays. This functionality does not rely on ThreadLocals and is
            enabled by default.
            So while logging is not completely garbage-free for web applications yet,
            the pressure on the garbage collector can still be significantly reduced.

          <h4>Disabling Garbage-free Logging</h4>
          <p>
            There are two separate system properties for manually controlling the mechanisms Log4j uses to avoid
            creating temporary objects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><tt>log4j2.enable.threadlocals</tt> - if "true" (the default for non-web applications)
              objects are stored in ThreadLocal fields and reused, otherwise new
              objects are created for each log event.</li>
            <li><tt>log4j2.enable.direct.encoders</tt> - if "true" (the default) log events are converted to text and this
              text is converted to bytes without creating temporary objects. Note:
              <em>synchronous</em> logging performance may be worse for multi-threaded applications in this mode due to
              synchronization on the shared buffer. If your application is multi-threaded and logging performance
              is important, consider using Async Loggers.
              </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Instead of system properties, the above properties can also be specified in a file named
            <tt>log4j2.component.properties</tt> by including this file in the classpath of the application.
          </p>
        <a name="Appenders" />
          <h4>Supported Appenders</h4>
          <p>
            The following <a href="appenders.html">appenders</a> are garbage-free during steady-state logging:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Console</li>
            <li>File</li>

          <h4>API Changes</h4>
          <p>
            Methods have been added to the <tt>Logger</tt> interface so that no vararg array objects are created
            when logging messages with up to ten parameters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, methods have been added to the <tt>Logger</tt> interface to log <tt>CharSequence</tt> messages.
            User-defined objects that implement the <tt>CharSequence</tt> interface can be logged without creating
            temporary objects: Log4j will try to turn CharSequence messages,
            Object messages and message parameters
            into text by appending them to a StringBuilder as a CharSequence.
            This avoids calling <tt>toString()</tt> on these objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Log4j may call <tt>toString()</tt> on message and parameter objects when garbage-free logging
            is disabled (when system property <tt>log4j2.enable.threadlocals</tt> is set to "false".)
          </p>
        <a name="codeImpact" />
        <h4>Impact on Application Code: Autoboxing</h4>
        <p>
          We made an effort to make logging garbage-free without requiring code changes in existing applications,
          but there is one area where this was not possible.
          When logging primitive values (i.e. int, double, boolean, etc.) the JVM
          autoboxes these primitive values to their Object wrapper equivalents, creating garbage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Log4j provides an <tt>Unboxer</tt> utility to prevent autoboxing of primitive parameters.
          This utility contains a thread-local pool of reused <tt>StringBuilder</tt>s.
          The <tt>Unboxer.box(primitive)</tt> methods write directly into a StringBuilder, and
          the resulting text will be copied into the final log message text without creating temporary objects.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">import static org.apache.logging.log4j.util.Unboxer.box;

        <h4>Response Time Latency</h4>
        <p>Response time is how long it takes to log a message under a certain load.
          What is often reported as latency is actually <em>service time</em>: how long it took to perform the operation.
          This hides the fact that a single spike in service time adds queueing delay for many of the subsequent operations.
          Service time is easy to measure (and often looks good on paper) but is irrelevant for users since it
          omits the time spent waiting for service.
          For this reason we report response time: service time plus wait time.
          See the <a href="../performance.html#responseTime">response time section</a> of the performance page for more detail.

        <h4>Async Loggers</h4>
        <p>The graph below compares "classic" logging to
          garbage-free logging response time behaviour for Log4j's Async Loggers.
          In the graph, "100k" means logging at a sustained load of 100,000 messages/second, "800k" is
          a sustained load of 800,000 messages/second.
        </p>
        <p><img src="../images/ResponseTimeAsyncClassicVsGcFree-label.png" /></p>
        <p>In <b>classic</b> mode we see numerous minor garbage collections which pause the application threads
          for 3 milliseconds or more. This quickly adds up to response time delays of almost 10
          milliseconds.
          As you can see in the graph, increasing the load shifts the curve to the left (there are more spikes).
          This makes sense: logging more means more pressure on the garbage collector resulting in more minor GC pauses.
          We experimented a little with reducing the load to 50,000 or even 5000 messages/second,
          but this did not eliminate the 3 millisecond pauses, it just made them occur less frequently.
          Note that all GC pauses in this test are minor GC pauses. We did not see any full garbage collections.</p>
        <p>In <b>garbage-free</b> mode, maximum response time remains well below 1 millisecond under a wide range of loads.
          (Max 780 us at 800,000 messages/sec, max 407 us at 600,000 messages/sec, with the 99% around 5 us for
          all loads up to 800,000 messages/sec.) Increasing or decreasing the load does not change the response time
          behaviour. We did not investigate the cause of the 200-300 microsecond pauses we saw in these tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we increased the load further we begin to see larger response time pauses for both classic and
          garbage-free logging.
          At sustained loads of 1 million messages/second or more we start to approach the maximum throughput of
          the underlying RandomAccessFile Appender (see the synchronous logging throughput chart below).
          At these loads the ringbuffer starts to fill up and backpressure kicks in: attempting to add another message
          when the ringbuffer is full will block until a free slot becomes available. We start to see response times
          of tens of milliseconds or more; and attempting to increase the load even more results in larger and larger
          response time spikes.
        </p>
        <h4>Synchronous File Logging</h4>
        <p>With synchronous file logging, garbage-free logging still performs better than classic logging,
          but the difference is less pronounced.
        </p>
        <p>At a workload of 100,000 messages/second, classic logging max response time was a little over 2 milliseconds
          where garbage-free logging was a little over 1 millisecond.
          When the workload is increased to 300,000 messages/second, classic logging shows response time pauses of 6
          milliseconds where the garbage-free response times were less than 3 milliseconds.
          It may be possible to improve on this, we did not investigate further yet.</p>

        <a name="Throughput" />
        <h4>Throughput of Garbage-free and Classic Logging is Similar</h4>
        <p>Throughput is roughly similar for garbage-free and classic logging.
          In our measurements, Log4j 2.6 in garbage-free mode had the highest throughput in single-threaded scenarios. In multi-threaded
          scenarios,  Log4j 2.6 "classic" had the highest throughput, with Log4j 2.6 in garbage-free mode and Log4j 2.5
          not far behind.</p>
        <p>The synchronous logging throughput results below are obtained with the
          <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">JMH</a> Java benchmark harness.
          See the <tt>org.apache.logging.log4j.perf.jmh.FileAppenderBenchmark</tt> source code in the log4j-perf module.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/garbage-free2.6-SyncThroughputLinux.png"
            alt="Throughput of Log4j 2.6 in garbage-free mode is slightly worse than in classic mode, but on par with 2.5 and much better than alternatives logging libraries" /></p>
        <p>(TODO: DOUBLE-CHECK) The above results are for <em>synchronous</em> logging. For <em>asynchronous</em> logging,
          there was no measurable difference in throughput between
          Log4j 2.6 in garbage-free mode and Log4j 2.6 in "classic" mode (allocating
          new objects on every logging call).</p>

          Custom Message implementations that implement <tt>org.apache.logging.log4j.util.StringBuilderFormattable</tt>
          can be converted to text by PatternLayout without creating temporary objects.
          Other layouts that convert LogEvents to text will likely also look for this interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Custom Layouts that want to be garbage-free should implement the <tt>Encoder&lt;LogEvent&gt;</tt> interface.
          For custom Layouts that convert a LogEvent to a text representation,
          the <tt>org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.StringBuilderEncoder</tt> class may be useful to convert this
          text to bytes in a garbage-free manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Custom Appenders that want to be garbage-free should provide their Layout with a
          <tt>ByteBufferDestination</tt> implementation that the Layout can directly write into.
        </p>
        <p>
          <tt>AbstractOutputStreamAppender</tt> has been modified to make the ConsoleAppender, (Rolling)FileAppender,
          (Rolling)RandomAccessFileAppender and MemoryMappedFileAppender garbage-free.
          An effort has been made to minimize impact on custom Appenders that extend
          <tt>AbstractOutputStreamAppender</tt>, but it is impossible to guarantee that changing the superclass
          will not impact any and all subclasses. Custom Appenders that extend
          <tt>AbstractOutputStreamAppender</tt> should verify that they still function correctly.
          In case there is a problem, system property <tt>log4j2.enable.direct.encoders</tt> can be set to "false"
          to revert to the pre-Log4j 2.6 behaviour.
