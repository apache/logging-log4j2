                <p>
                    Log4j 2 contains a convenient Scala wrapper for the
                    <a href="../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/Logger.html">Logger</a>
                    API.
                </p>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">import org.apache.logging.log4j.scala.Logging

class MyClass extends BaseClass with Logging {
    def doStuff(): Unit = {
        logger.info("Doing stuff")
    }
}</pre>
                <p>
                    The output from the call to logger.info() will vary significantly depending on the configuration
                    used. See the
                    <a href="./configuration.html">Configuration</a>
                    section for more details.
                </p>
                <h4>Substituting Parameters</h4>
                <p>
                    Frequently the purpose of logging is to provide information about what is happening in the system,
                    which requires including information about the objects being manipulated. In Scala, you can use
                    <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/string-interpolation.html">string interpolation</a>
                    to achieve this:
                </p>
                <pre class="prettyprint">logger.debug(s"Logging in user ${user.getName} with birthday ${user.calcBirthday}")</pre>
                <p>
                    Since the Scala Logger is implemented with macros, the String construction and method invocations
                    will only occur when debug logging is enabled.
                </p>

                <h4>Logger Names</h4>
                <p>
                    Most logging implementations use a hierarchical scheme for matching logger names with logging
                    configuration. In this scheme the logger name hierarchy is represented by '.' characters in the
                    logger name, in a fashion very similar to the hierarchy used for Java/Scala package names.
                    The Logging trait will automatically name the Logger accordingly to the class it is being used in.
