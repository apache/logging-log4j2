          <p>
            Log4j 1.x allowed for extension by requiring class attributes on most of the configuration
            declarations. In the case of some elements, notably the PatternLayout, the only way to add
            new pattern converters was to extend the PatternLayout class and add them via code. One of
            goals of Log4j 2 is to make extending it extremely easy through the use of plugins.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Log4j 2 a plugin is declared by adding a Plugin annotation to the class declaration. During
            initialization the Configuration will invoke the PluginManager to locate all the Log4j plugins
            that are located in the declared <a href="./configuration.html#ConfigurationSyntax">packages</a>.
            As the configuration is processed the appropriate plugins will be automatically configured and
            initialized.  Log4j 2 utilizes a few different categories of plugins which are described in the following
            sections.
          </p>
        </subsection>
        <a name="Core"/>
        <subsection name="Core">
          <p>
            Core plugins are those that are directly represented by an element in a configuration file, such as an
            Appender, Logger or Filter. Custom plugins that conform to the rules laid out in the next paragraph
            may simply be referenced in the configuration, provided they are appropriate configured to be
            loaded by the PluginManager.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every Core plugin must declare a static method that is marked with a PluginFactory annotation. To
            allow the Configuration to pass the correct parameters to the method, every
            parameter to the method must be annotated as one of the following attribute types. Each
            attribute or element annotation must include the name that must be present in the configuration
            in order to match the configuration item to its respective parameter.
          </p>
          <h4>Attribute Types</h4>
            <dl>
              <dt>PluginAttr</dt>
              <dd>The parameter must resolve to a String, although it can be the String representation of a
              boolean. numeric value, or any other Object that can be created from a String value.</dd>
              <dt>PluginElement</dt>
              <dd>The parameter may represent a complex object that itself has parameters that can be configured.</dd>
              <dt>PluginConfiguration</dt>
              <dd>The current Configuration object will be passed to the plugin as a parameter.</dd>
            </dl>
        </subsection>
        <a name="Converters"/>
        <subsection name="Converters">
          <p>
            Converters are used by
            <a href="../log4j-core/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/layout/PatternLayout.html">PatternLayout</a>
            to render the elements identified by the conversion pattern. Every converter must specify its type as
            "Converter" on the Plugin attribute, have a static newInstance method that accepts an array of Strings as
            its only parameter and returns an instance of the Converter, and must have a ConverterKeys annotation
            present that contains the array of converter patterns that will cause the Converter to be selected.
            Converters that are meant to handle LogEvents must extend the LogEventPatternConverter class and
            must implement a format method that accepts a LogEvent and a StringBuilder as arguments. The Converter
            should append the result of its operation to the StringBuilder.
          </p>
          <p>
            A second type of Converter is the FileConverter - which must have "FileConverter" specified in the
            type attribute of the Plugin annotation. While similar to a LogEventPatternConverter, instead
            of a single format method these Converters will have two variations; one that takes an Object and
            one that takes an array of Objects instead of the LogEvent. Both append to the provided StringBuilder
            in the same fashion as a LogEventPatternConverter. These Converters are typically used by the
            RollingFileAppender to construct the name of the file to log to.

        <a name="KeyProviders"/>
        <subsection name="KeyProviders">
          <p>
          Some components within Log4j may provide the ability to perform data encryption. These components require
          a secret key to perform the encryption. Applications may provide the key by creating a class that
          implements the <a href="../log4j-core/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/helpers/SecretKeyProvider.html">SecretKeyProvider</a>
          interface.
          </p>
        </subsection>
        <a name="Lookups"/>
        <subsection name="Lookups">
          <p>
            Lookups are perhaps the simplest plugins of all. They must declare their type as "Lookup" on the
            plugin annotation and must implement the StrLookup interface. They will have two methods; a
            lookup method that accepts a String key and returns a String value and a second lookup method that
            accepts both a LogEvent and a String key and returns a String. Lookups may be referenced by
            specifying ${<i>name</i>:key} where <i>name</i> is the name specified in the Plugin annotation and
            key is the name of the item to locate.

          <p>
          Scanning for annotated classes dynamically takes a bit of time during application initialization. Log4j
          avoids this by scanning its classes during the build. In the Maven build, the PluginManager is invoked as
          shown below and then the resulting Map is stored in a file in the jar being constructed. Log4j will locate
          all the files created this way and and preload them, which shortens startup time considerably. Adding the
          following plugin definition to your project's pom.xml will cause the plugin manager to be called during the
          build. It will store the resulting file in the correct location under the directory specified in the first
          argument after scanning all the components located under the package specified in the second argument.

          <h4>Using the Java annotation processor</h4>
          <p>
            Annotated classes marked with <code>@Plugin</code> or <code>@PluginAliases</code> are now automatically
            preloaded when you include the log4j-core artifact, or more specifically, when you use the following
            dependency:
          </p>
          <!-- FIXME: could this file be renamed to plugins.xml.vm to gain access to ${Log4jReleaseVersion} -->
          <pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>log4j-plugin-processor</artifactId>
    <version>2.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
          ]]></pre>
          <p>
            Note, however, that explicitly adding this dependency is unnecessary when you include log4j-core as it is
            used by log4j-core.
