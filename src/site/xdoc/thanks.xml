    <section name="Log4j 2 Project Thanks">
      <p>
        Log4j 2 is a successful project because of the large and diverse community that contributes
        to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a handful of tools that developers in the community use;
        some are open-source and
        some are commercial.
        We'd like to extend a special thanks to these communities/companies:
