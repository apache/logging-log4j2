    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-2-13-3]
== 2.13.3

Release date:: 2020-05-10

This release contains a fix for bug https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2838[LOG4J2-2838].

Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
`log4j-slf4j-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and `log4j-slf4j18-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and later.

Note that the XML, JSON and YAML formats changed in the 2.11.0 release: they no longer have the `timeMillis` attribute and instead have an `Instant` element with `epochSecond` and `nanoOfSecond` attributes.

The Log4j 2.13.3 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Log4j 2.13.3 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6 and Log4j 2.11.2 is the last release to support Java 7.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
