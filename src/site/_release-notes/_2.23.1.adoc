[#release-notes-2-23-1]
== 2.23.1

Release date:: 2024-03-06

This release contains several small fixes and some dependency updates.


[#release-notes-2-23-1-changed]
=== Changed

* Fix handling of `LoggerContextAware` lookups (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/2309[2309])
* Fix NPE in `PatternProcessor` for a `UNIX_MILLIS` pattern (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/2346[2346])
* Improve performance of `CloseableThreadContext#closeMap()` (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/2296[2296])

[#release-notes-2-23-1-fixed]
=== Fixed

* Fix that parameterized message formatting doesn't throw an exception when there are insufficient number of parameters (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/2343[2343])
* Fix `StatusLogger` log level filtering when debug mode is enabled (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/2337[2337])
* Add `log4j2.StatusLogger.dateFormatZone` system property to set the time-zone `StatusLogger` uses to format `java.time.Instant`. Without this, formatting patterns accessing to time-zone-specific fields (e.g., year-of-era) cause failures. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/2322[2322])
* Fix `StatusLogger` to correctly read `log4j2.StatusLogger.properties` resource (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/2354[2354])
