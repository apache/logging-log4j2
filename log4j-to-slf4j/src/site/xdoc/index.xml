        <section name="Log4j 2 to SLF4J Adapter">

            <p>
              The Log4j 2 to SLF4J Adapter allows applications coded to the Log4j 2 API to be routed to SLF4J.
              Use of this adapter may cause some loss of performance as the Log4j 2 Messages must be formatted
              before they can be passed to SLF4J. With Log4j 2 as the implementation these would normally be
              formatted only when they are accessed by a Filter or Appender.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section name="Requirements">
           <p>
             The Log4j 2 to SLF4J adapter is dependent on the Log4j 2 API and the SLF4J API.
          </p>
        </section>

      <section name="Usage">
        <p>
          Include this jar, the SLF4J jar(s) and an SLF4J logging implementation jar together. Configure
          the logging implementation as required.
        </p>
           <p>
             <b><em>Use of the SLF4J adapter (log4j-to-slf4j-2.0.jar) together with 
             the SLF4J bridge (log4j-slf4j-impl-2.0.jar) should 
             never be attempted as it will cause events to endlessly be routed between
             SLF4J and Log4j 2.</em></b>
