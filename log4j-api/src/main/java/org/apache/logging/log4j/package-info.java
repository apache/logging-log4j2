 * <p>
 *     The main entry point into Log4j is the {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager} class which can be used to
 *     obtain {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger} objects, the current
 *     {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.spi.LoggerContext}, a new {@code LoggerContext}, and the current
 *     {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.spi.LoggerContextFactory}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.Marker} objects can be obtained through the
 *     {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.MarkerManager}. The MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) can be
 *     used through the {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.ThreadContext} class.
