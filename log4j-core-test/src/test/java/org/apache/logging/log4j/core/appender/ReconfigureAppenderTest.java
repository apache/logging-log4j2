        // appender instance. The problem here is that the file manager is create with the name

        // ourselves. This means that the rolling file appender has been stopped (previous method) AND its
        // manager has been removed.
        this.removeManagerUsingReflection();

        this.createAndAddAppender();

        // because we have a new instance of file manager, this will create a new output stream. We can verify
        // this by looking inside the filepattern.1.log file inside the working directory, and noticing that
        // we have 'test message 1' followed by 'test message 3'. 'test message 2' is missing because we attempted
        // to write while the output stream was closed.
        logger.info("test message 3");

        // possible fixes:
        // 1) create the RollingFileManager and set it's name to FILE PATTERN when using DirectWriteRolloverStrategy
        // 2) when stopping the appender (and thus the manager), remove on FILE PATTERN if DirectWriteRolloverStrategy
        // 3) on OutputStreamManager.getOutputStream(), determine if the output stream is closed, and if it is create
        //              a new one. Note that this isn't really desirable as the only fix as if the file pattern had to
        // change
        //              an instance of file manager would still exist in MAP, causing a resource leak.

        // now the obvious problem here is that if multiple file appenders use the same rolling file manager. We may run
        // into a case where the file manager is removed and the output stream is closed, and the remaining appenders
        // may not work correctly. I'm not sure  of the use case in this scenario, and if people actually do this
        // but based on the code it would be possible. I have also not tested this scenario out as it is not the
        // scenario we would ever use, but it should be considered while fixing this issue.
