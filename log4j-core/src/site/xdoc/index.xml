            <p>
              The Log4j 2 implementation provides the functional components of the logging system.
              Users are free to create their own plugins and include them in the logging configuration.
            </p>

            <p>
                As of version 2.4, Log4j 2 requires Java 7. Versions 2.3 and earlier require Java 6.
                Some features may require optional
                <a href="dependencies.html">dependencies</a>. These dependencies are specified in the
                documentation for those features.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below is a list of Log4j features that require external dependencies.
              See the <a href="dependencies.html#Dependency_Tree">Dependency Tree</a>
              for the exact list of JAR files needed for these features.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>JSON configuration requires the Jackson Data Processor.</li>
                <li>Async Loggers require the LMAX Disruptor.</li>
                <li>SMTPAppender requires Javax Mail.</li>
                <li>JMSQueueAppender and JMSTopicAppender require a JMS implementation like
                <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/">Apache ActiveMQ</a>.</li>
                <li>Windows color support requires <a href="http://jansi.fusesource.org/">Jansi</a>.</li>
                <li>The JDBC Appender requires a JDBC driver for the database you choose to write events to.</li>
                <li>The JPA Appender requires the Java Persistence API classes, a JPA provider implementation,
                and a decorated entity that the user implements. It also requires an appropriate JDBC driver.</li>
                <li>The NoSQL Appender with MongoDB provider requires the MongoDB Java Client driver.</li>
                <li>The NoSQL Appender with Apache CouchDB provider requires the LightCouch CouchDB client library.</li>
                <li>The NoSQL Appender can be customized with a user-supplied provider, which will require the
