/**
 * <p>
 * Users of the JPA appender MUST extend this class, using JPA annotations on the concrete class and all of its
 * accessor methods (as needed) to map them to the proper table and columns. Accessors you do not want persisted should
 * be annotated with {@link Transient @Transient}. All accessors should call {@link #getWrappedEvent()} and delegate the
 * call to the underlying event. Users may want to instead extend {@link BasicLogEventEntity}, which takes care of all
 * of this for you.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The concrete class must have two constructors: a public no-arg constructor to convince the JPA provider that it's a
 * valid entity, and a public constructor that takes a single {@link LogEvent event} and passes it to the parent class
 * with {@link #AbstractLogEventWrapperEntity(LogEvent) super(event)}. Furthermore, the concrete class must be annotated
 * {@link javax.persistence.Entity @Entity} and {@link javax.persistence.Table @Table} and must implement a fully
 * mutable ID property annotated with {@link javax.persistence.Id @Id} and
 * {@link javax.persistence.GeneratedValue @GeneratedValue} to tell the JPA provider how to calculate an ID for new
 * events.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Many of the return types of {@link LogEvent} methods (e.g., {@link StackTraceElement}, {@link Message},
 * {@link Marker}, {@link Throwable}, 
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.ThreadContext.ContextStack ThreadContext.ContextStack}, and 
 * {@link Map Map&lt;String, String&gt}) will not be recognized by the JPA provider. In conjunction with 
 * {@link javax.persistence.Convert @Convert}, you can use the converters in the 
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.jpa.converter} package to convert these types to database columns.
 * If you want to retrieve log events from the database, you can create a true POJO entity and also use these 
 * converters for extracting persisted values.<br>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The mutator methods in this class not specified in {@link LogEvent} are no-op methods, implemented to satisfy the JPA
 * requirement that accessor methods have matching mutator methods. If you create additional accessor methods, you must
 * likewise create matching no-op mutator methods.
 * </p>
