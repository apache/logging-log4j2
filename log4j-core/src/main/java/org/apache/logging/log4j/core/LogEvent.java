/**
 * Provides contextual information about a logged message. A LogEvent must be {@link java.io.Serializable} so that it
 * may be transmitted over a network connection, output in a
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.SerializedLayout}, and many other uses. Besides containing a
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.message.Message}, a LogEvent has a corresponding
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.Level} that the message was logged at. If a
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.Marker} was used, then it is included here. The contents of the
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.ThreadContext} at the time of the log call are provided via
 * {@link #getContextMap()} and {@link #getContextStack()}. If a {@link java.lang.Throwable} was included in the log
 * call, then it is provided via {@link #getThrown()}. When this class is serialized, the attached Throwable will
 * be wrapped into a {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.impl.ThrowableProxy} so that it may be safely serialized
 * and deserialized properly without causing problems if the exception class is not available on the other end.
 * <p>
 * Since version 2.7, {@link #getContextMap()} is deprecated in favor of {@link #getContextData()}, which
 * can carry both {@code ThreadContext} data as well as other context data supplied by the
 * {@linkplain org.apache.logging.log4j.core.impl.ContextDataInjectorFactory configured}
