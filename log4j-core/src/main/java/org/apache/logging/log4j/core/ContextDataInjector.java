/**
 * Responsible for initializing the context data of LogEvents. Context data is data that is set by the application to be
 * included in all subsequent log events.
 * <p><b>NOTE: It is no longer recommended that custom implementations of this interface be provided as it is
 * difficult to do. Instead, provide a custom ContextDataProvider.</b></p>
 * <p>
 * The source of the context data is implementation-specific. The default source for context data is the ThreadContext.
 * </p><p>
 * In some asynchronous models, work may be delegated to several threads, while conceptually this work shares the same
 * context. In such models, storing context data in {@code ThreadLocal} variables is not convenient or desirable.
 * Users can configure the {@code ContextDataInjectorFactory} to provide custom {@code ContextDataInjector} objects,
 * in order to initialize log events with context data from any arbitrary context.
 * </p><p>
 * When providing a custom {@code ContextDataInjector}, be aware that the {@code ContextDataInjectorFactory} may be
 * invoked multiple times and the various components in Log4j that need access to context data may each have their own
 * instance of {@code ContextDataInjector}.
 * This includes the object(s) that populate log events, but also various lookups and filters that look at
 * context data to determine whether an event should be logged.
 * </p><p>
 * Implementors should take particular note of how the different methods in the interface have different thread-safety
 * guarantees to enable optimal performance.
