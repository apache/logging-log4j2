            <p>
              The SLF4J Bridge allows applications coded to the SLF4J API to use
              Log4j 2 as the implementation.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section name="Requirements">
           <p>
             The SLF4J bridge requires at least Java 5 and has a dependency on the Log4j 2 API.
          </p>
        </section>

      <section name="Usage">
        <p>
          The SLF4J bindings provided in this Bridge cause all the SLF4J APIs to be routed to Log4j 2. Simply
          include the SLF4J Bindings jar along with the Log4j 2 jars to cause all SLF4J logging to be handled
          by Log4j 2.
