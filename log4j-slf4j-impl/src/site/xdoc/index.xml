        <section name="Log4j 2 SLF4J Binding">

            <p>
              The Log4j 2 SLF4J Binding allows applications coded to the SLF4J API to use
              Log4j 2 as the implementation.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section name="Requirements">
           <p>
             The Log4j 2 SLF4J Binding requires at least Java 6 and has a dependency 
             on the Log4j 2 API as well as the SLF4J API.
          </p>
        </section>

      <section name="Usage">
        <p>
          The SLF4J binding provided in this component cause all the SLF4J APIs to be routed to Log4j 2. Simply
          include the Log4j 2 SLF4J Binding jar along with the Log4j 2 jars and SLF4J API jar to cause all SLF4J
          logging to be handled by Log4j 2.
        </p>
           <p>
             <b><em>Use of the Log4j 2 SLF4J Binding (log4j-slf4j-impl-2.0.jar) together with 
             the SLF4J adapter (log4j-to-slf4j-2.0.jar) should 
             never be attempted, as it will cause events to endlessly be routed between
             SLF4J and Log4j 2.</em></b>
