# `META-INF/services/*` files are automatically generated by `bnd-maven-plugin`.
# We use `bnd:jar` goal, which only places them into the JAR.
# As a result, tests of the same artifact (running against `target/` contents, not the JAR) don't have them.
# To mitigate this, we manually create this file here only for tests.
# `logging-parent` version `10.5.0` will switch from `bnd:jar` to `bnd:bnd-process`, then this hack won't be needed.
