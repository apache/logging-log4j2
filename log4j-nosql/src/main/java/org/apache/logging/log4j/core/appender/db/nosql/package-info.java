/**
 * The NoSQL Appender supports writing log events to NoSQL databases. The following NoSQL databases are currently
 * supported. You can also easily extend this to support other NoSQL databases by implementing just three interfaces:
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.nosql.NoSQLObject NoSQLObject}, 
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.nosql.NoSQLConnection NoSQLConnection}, and 
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.nosql.NoSQLProvider NoSQLProvider}. You will need the client library for your
 * NoSQL database of choice on the classpath to use this appender; these Maven dependencies are optional and will not
 * automatically be added to your classpath.<br>
 * <br>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>: org.mongodb:mongo-java-driver:2.11.1 or newer
 *     must be on the classpath.</li>
 *     <li><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache CouchDB</a>: org.lightcouch:lightcouch:0.0.5 or
 *     newer must be on the classpath.</li>
 * </ul>
