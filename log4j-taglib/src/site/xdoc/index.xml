     <title>Log4j Tag Library</title>

     <section name="Log4j Tag Library">

       <p>The Log4j Log Tag Library creates the capability of inserting log
         statements in JSPs without the use of Java scripting. It uses the standard Log4j 2 API to log
         messages according to your Log4j configuration.</p>

       <p>This tag library is based on the
         <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/log/">Jakarta Commons Log Taglib</a> by Joseph Ottinger and James
         Strachan. For the most part, logging tags written against Jakarta Commons Log Taglib should
         work against this library as well. However, the "category" attribute from Jakarta has become
         the "logger" attribute in this library.</p>

     </section>

     <section name="Requirements">
       <p>
         The Log4j Tag Library requires at least Servlet 2.5 (or Java EE 5), at least
         JSP 2.1 (or Java EE 5), and is dependent on the Log4j 2 API.
       </p>
       <p>
         <b><em>Important Note!</em></b> For performance reasons, containers often ignore certain JARs known not to
         contain TLDs and do not scan them for TLD files. Importantly, Tomcat 7 &lt;7.0.43 ignores all JAR files named
         log4j*.jar, which prevents the JSP tag library from being automatically discovered. This does not affect
         Tomcat 6.x and has been fixed in Tomcat 7.0.43, Tomcat 8, and later. In Tomcat 7 &lt;7.0.43 you
         will need to change <code>catalina.properties</code> and remove "log4j*.jar" from the <code>jarsToSkip</code>
         property. You may need to do something similar on other containers if they skip scanning Log4j JAR files.
       </p>

     <section name="Usage">
       <p>In accordance with the <a href="../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/Logger.html">Logger</a>
         API, this tag library has tags to
         support the following logging calls: "catching", "entry", "exit", "log", "trace", "debug",
         "info", "warn", "error", and "fatal". The "trace" tag was not supported in Jakarta Commons Log
         Taglib. The "setLogger", "catching", "entry", and "trace" tags are new to this library. This
         tag library also supports the conditional tag "ifEnabled" (new) and troubleshooting tag "dump"
         (existed in Jakarta Commons Log Taglib).</p>

       <p>By default, this tag library uses a different Logger for each JSP named after the JSP ID.
         You can customize the Logger in any of the logging tags or the "ifEnabled" tag with the
         "logger" attribute. You can also use the "setLogger" tag to specify the Logger that should apply
         for the rest of a JSP's execution. If the "setLogger" tag comes before any other logging tags in
         a JSP, the default Logger for that JSP will not be created, but instead the specified logger is
         the only one that will be used.</p>

       <p>Every effort was made to optimize these tags and ensure decent performance, but users of
         this library should keep in mind that the creation and execution of JSP tags adds significant
         overhead to the standard Log4j method calls. While the "trace", "debug", and "info" options are
         available in this library, their uses are not nano-second order of magnitude with logging off
         that users may be used to with standard Log4j method calls. Therefore, they should be used
         sparingly. Use of the "ifEnabled" tag does not improve this performance; this tag is available
         to conditionally evaluate other actions in addition to logging actions.</p>

       <p>For detailed documentation of each tag, see the <a href="tagreference.html">Tag Library Reference</a> or the
         <a href="tlddoc/index.html">TLDDoc Documentation</a>.</p>
