/**
 * Identifies a Plugin Value and its corresponding attribute alias for configuration formats that don't distinguish
 * between values and attributes. A value is typically used differently from an attribute in that it is either the
 * main configuration value required or it is the only value needed to create a plugin. A plugin value can be injected
 * as a parameter to a static {@linkplain PluginFactory factory method}, or as a field or single-parameter method in a
 * plugin {@linkplain org.apache.logging.log4j.plugins.util.Builder builder class}.
 *
 * <p>For example, a Property plugin corresponds to a property entry in a configuration file. The property name is
 * specified as an attribute, and the property value is specified as a value.</p>
