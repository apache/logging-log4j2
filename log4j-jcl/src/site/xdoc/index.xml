        <section name="Commons Logging Bridge">

            <p>
              The Commons Logging Bridge allows applications coded to the Commons Logging API to use
              Log4j 2 as the implementation.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section name="Requirements">
           <p>
             The Commons Logging Bridge requires at least Java 6 and is dependent on the Log4j 2 API
             and the Commons Logging API.
          </p>
        </section>

      <section name="Usage">
        <p>
          Using the Commons Logging Bridge is straightforward. Simply add the bridge jar along with
          the other Log4j 2 jars and the Commons Logging API jar, and all logging done using the
          Commons Logging API will be routed to Log4j.
