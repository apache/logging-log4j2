              Apache Log4j 2.0-beta8 RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.0-beta8 release!

Apache log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade to
Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides
many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logback's
architecture.

This is the tenth release of Log4j 2 and is being made available to encourage use and feedback from the community.

Apache Log4j 2.0-beta8 requires a minimum of Java 6 to build and run. Basic compatibility with
Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j-1.2-api component, however it does not implement some of the
very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to
org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.
