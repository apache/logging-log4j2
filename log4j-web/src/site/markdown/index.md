# Web Servlet Containers

The Web module provides support for automatically enabling Log4j in Servlet containers.

See the user manual page on [Web Applications and JSPs](../manual/webapp.html)
for details on using Log4j 2 in Web Applications.

## Requirements

The Web module requires Servlet 2.5 at minimum and is dependent on the Log4j 2 API and implementation.
For more information, see [Runtime Dependencies](../runtime-dependencies.html).
