Building Log4j 2
  
To build Log4j 2, you need a JDK implementation version 1.6 or greater, and Apache Maven.
Note that building the site requires Maven 3.0.5, while everything else works
fine with any version of Maven 3.

To perform a RAT check, run:

mvn apache-rat:check

To perform a Clirr check on the API modules, run

mvn clirr:check -pl log4j-api
mvn clirr:check -pl log4j-1.2-api

To build the site, from a command line, run:

mvn clean install
mvn site

On Windows, use a local staging directory, for example:

mvn site:stage-deploy -DstagingSiteURL=file:///%HOME%/log4j

On UNIX, use a local staging directory, for example:

mvn site:stage-deploy -DstagingSiteURL=file:///$HOME/log4j

To test, run:

mvn test

Then, to test OSGi, you must first create the jars:

mvn install -DskipTests
mvn package -DskipTests

Next, you can run the tests as usual, which will pick up the jar files to use as OSGi bundles from the various target 
directories:

mvn test
