### JUL configuration for Log4jBridgeHandlerTest
# JVM must be started with to use this file:  -Djava.util.logging.config.file=path_to_this_file

# Install bridge but also output JUL-logs to console (order of handler matters!):
handlers = org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.Log4jBridgeHandler, java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# append given suffix to logger names (e.g. "_JUL"); a dot is prepended automatically
org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.Log4jBridgeHandler.appendSuffix = _JUL
# Propagate levels
org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.Log4jBridgeHandler.propagateLevels = true

# ConsoleHandler defaults to INFO filtering, but we need all here
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = ALL
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format = JUL: %1$tT.%1$tL %4$s [%3$s: %2$s] - %5$s%6$s%n

# Note: JUL levels are: SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST, ALL
# set default JUL logging level (FINER is for entering, exiting etc.)
org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.Log4jBridgeHandlerTest.level = FINER
