        The IOStreams component is a <a href="../log4j-api/index.html">Log4j API</a> extension that provides numerous
        classes from
        <a class="javadoc" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/package-summary.html">java.io</a>
        that can either write to a
        <a class="javadoc" href="../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/Logger.html">Logger</a>
        while writing to another <code>OutputStream</code> or <code>Writer</code>, or the contents read by an
        <code>InputStream</code> or <code>Reader</code> can be
        <a href="http://www.eaipatterns.com/WireTap.html">wiretapped</a> by a <code>Logger</code>.

      <p>
        The Log4j IOStreams API extension requires Java 6 and the Log4j API. This component was introduced in Log4j 2.1.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Usage">
      <p>
        The main entry point for the IOStreams module is the builder class
        <a class="javadoc" href="apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/io/IoBuilder.html">IoBuilder</a>, and in particular,
        the <code>IoBuilder.forLogger()</code> methods. One primary usage of this API extension is for setting up
        loggers in the JDBC API. For example:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
PrintWriter logger = IoBuilder.forLogger(DriverManager.class)
                              .setLevel(Level.DEBUG)
                              .buildPrintWriter();
DriverManager.setLogWriter(logger);
      ]]></pre>
      <p>
        Using the <code>IoBuilder</code> class, there are a few more options that can be set. In general, there are six
        primary classes one can build from it: <code>Reader</code>, <code>Writer</code>, <code>PrintWriter</code>,
        <code>InputStream</code>, <code>OutputStream</code>, and <code>PrintStream</code>. The input-oriented classes
        are for wiretapping, and the output-oriented classes are for creating either an output class that solely outputs
        its lines as log messages, or an output filter class that logs all lines output through it to its delegate
        output class.
